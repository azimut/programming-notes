  - aka princeton architecture
  - "von neumann bottleneck"
    - An instruction to fetch something from memory to cpu. Takes 2 fetch cycles.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture
  - instructions and data do NOT share the same bus (or stored in the same place)
    - the instruction memory can be read-only
    - as a consequence they could have different
      - word width (requiring wider address bus)
      - total sizes (requiring wider data bus)a
  - used for
    - real time processing (DSPs)
    - low-power applications
