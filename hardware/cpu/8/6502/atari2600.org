* Hardware

|-------------+---------------+----------------|
| CPU         | 1.19 MHz      | 6507 processor |
| RAM         | 128 bytes     | 6532 RIOT Chip |
| ROM         | 4kB           | Game Cartridge |
| Audio/Video |               | TIA Chip       |
| Input       | 2 controllers |                |
| Output      | RCA           | NTSC/PAL/SECAM |
|-------------+---------------+----------------|

TIA  = Television Interface Adapter
RIOT = Ram IO Timer

Schematics:

- 6507
  - Cheaper than 6502
  - 28 pin package
    - axed pin A15-A13 (13 bit addressable memory)
    - axed pin IRQ
    - axed pin NMI
    - other stuff?

- TIA (custom chip)

** 2 Hardware Architecture

- Atari
  - 72 company founded
  - 75 sale, console based on programmable design

- Arcade Games: Pong, Tank
  - Common Themes
    - player 1, 2
    - scoreboard
    - ball/missile
    - playing field (arena,obstacles)
    - collision

- MOS 6502 (CPU picked)
  - picked over "Intel 8080" and "Motorola 6800"
  - due price
  - was bought by Commodore before release

- course uses NTSC for the TIA chip

- on a byte there is a
  - LSB (least significant bit) the rightmost bit
  - MSB (most significant bit) the leftmost bit

- We used to use =base 12= to count (egyptians/babylonians)
  - why? we used the in-between phalanges on the fingers to count
