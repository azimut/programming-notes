** Experimenting with LEDs (1-3)

- Each LED color has
  - different voltage range (?
  - same current requirement (within the voltage range)

- Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)
  - the voltage drops across every component has to be zero
  - if we put 1 component that component has to consume 5v
  - In the example, a 155ohm resistor would drop 3.1v of the circuit.
    - Leaving the LED with 1.9v.
    - It needs 20mA
    - In reality we use a 220ohm (RRB)
    - If we put an 1k (BbR) it will be a bit dimmer.
      With less current consumption.

** Connecting to a Mystery signal (4-)



* Logic Families

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TpLYx1iZD4

- Both 5v
- Output level for high signal
  - TTL: 2.4v-
  - CMOS: 3.5-
- We can combine them as long as CMOS drives TTL
- TTL pulls his inputs high ?

** TTL  (63) - Transistor Transistor Logic

- Logic family build from Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)
- 7400 series originally build on it
- still used as "glue logic" interfacing between more densely integrated components
- consumes more power than CMOS

** CMOS (67) - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

- A type of MOSFET that uses complementary and symetricall pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETS.
- 99% of ICs were made using CMOS
- high noise immunity
- low static power consuption

** NMOS (N-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor)

- uses ~n-type~ MOSFETs to implement logic gates.
- NMOS AND-by-default logic can produce unusual glitches or buggy behaviour, such as 6502 "illegal opcodes"
- in the 70's faster than CMOS
- high power consumption
