  - aka latches, aka bistable multivibrator
  - have 2 stable states
  - can store state information

* Logic Families

- Both 5v
- Output level for high signal
  - TTL: 2.4v-
  - CMOS: 3.5-
- We can combine them as long as CMOS drives TTL
- TTL pulls his inputs high ?

** TTL  (63) - Transistor Transistor Logic

- Logic family build from Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)
- 7400 series originally build on it
- still used as "glue logic" interfacing between more densely integrated components
- consumes more power than CMOS

** CMOS (67) - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

- A type of MOSFET that uses complementary and symetricall pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETS.
- 99% of ICs were made using CMOS
- high noise immunity
- low static power consuption

** NMOS (N-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor)

- uses ~n-type~ MOSFETs to implement logic gates.
- NMOS AND-by-default logic can produce unusual glitches or buggy behaviour, such as 6502 "illegal opcodes"
- in the 70's faster than CMOS
- high power consumption
