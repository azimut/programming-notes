- von neumann architecture
- memory mapped I/O
- EEPROM variants in late 80's
- 5 registers that are not part of the memory:
  - an 8-bit accumulator A
  - an 8-bit index register X
  - an 8-bit stack pointer SP with two most significant bits hardwired to 1
  - a 13-bit program counter PC
  - and an 8-bit condition code register CCR
- low powered variations of 05
