- 1976
- Models: 8048, 8035, 8748
- Intel's first =Microcontroller= (aka micro computer)
- Manufactured in the 90's to support older designs (cheap)
- Harvard architecture (modified) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Harvard_architecture
  - loose separation between code and data
  - _allows memory that contains instructions to be accesed as data_

- notes https://jhnbyrn.github.io/951-KLR-PAGES/reading_code.html

* architecture

- 11MHz (divided by 15 internally?)
- 8 bit
- 96 instructions (90% single byte)

** PSW - Program Status Word

- 4 MSB stored at the top of the ~stack~ when a subroutine call or interrupt
- reflect information about status of ram&cpu
- can be read as a whole
- From LSB to MSB
  - 3 bit stack pointer
  - 1 bit unused
  - 1 bit (register) BS Bank-Select switch
    #+begin_src asm
      sel rb0 ; = 0 for R0  - R7
      sel rb1 ; = 1 for R0' - R7'
    #+end_src
  - 1 bit F0 flag
  - 1 bit auxiliary carry flag
  - 1 bit carry flag

** Program Counter

#+begin_src
    |----+------+-----|
MSB | 11 | 8-10 | 0-7 | LSB
    |----+------+-----|
#+end_src

- stored at the top of the ~stack~ on subroutine call or interrupt
- reset to 0 when power-on or RESET is received

- 12 bits wide (from LSB to MSB)
  - 8 bits for ~address~ within a page
  - 3 bits for ~page~ addressing
    |---+-----+-----+-----|
    | P | BIT | SRT | END |
    |---+-----+-----+-----|
    | 0 | 000 | 000 | 0FF |
    | 1 | 001 | 100 | 1FF |
    | 2 | 010 | 200 | 2FF |
    | 3 | 011 | 300 | 3FF |
    |---+-----+-----+-----|
  - 1 bit needed only when _external memory_ is employed
    - under programmer's only control
      #+begin_src asm
        sel mb0
        sel mb1
      #+end_src
    - =0 program memory in ~memory bank~ 0 (0-2047)
    - =1 program mempry in ~memory bank~ 1 (2048-4095)

- unconditional jump & call instruction
  - instruction
    - 8 bit opcode
      - 5 bit for opcode
      - 3 bit MSB address
      - there is an _unique opcode for each page_ that a jump or call can transfer control to
    - 8 bit address
  - replace 11 bits of the ~program counter~
    - transfer control anywhere within a 2K address range
      - 4 pages of external program memory
      - 4 pages of resident program memory

- conditional jump instructions
  - can transfer control only _within the page_ containing the instruction
  - use 2(two) bytes
    - 1(one) for the opcode/instruction
    - 1(one) for the adddress
      - replaces the LSB of the ~program counter~

** ROM

- 1K internal for _program memory_
  - segmented into 4(four) 256-byte blocks/pages
- 3k of additional support for external ROM for _program memory_
- 4k of total ROM supported

** RAM

- Can be expanded to access 256 bytes extra of external _data memory_
  - 64+256 = 320 bytes

- 64-256 bytes internal for _data memory_
  - (0-31) Lower Half
    - (0-7) 8 registers of 8bit
      - =Register Inderect Addressing=
        R0/R1 may be used as *RAM pointers* to access memory containing data.
        #+begin_src asm
          mov a, @r0 ; a = *r0
        #+end_src
    - (8-23) 8-Level stack
      - addressed by the stack pointer during subroutine calls
      - 8 stack locations in 16 RAM locations (2 locations per address)
      - each will contain the ~program counter~ + 4MSB of the ~PSW~
    - (24-31) Optional second register stack
      - R0' - R7'
      - can be used in place of R0-R7
      - useful during interrupts
  - (32-64) Upper Half
    - Data Store
      - up to the programmer
      - accessed only by R0, R1

** Program Memory

- 1024/2048/4096 words 8 bit wide addressed by the =program counter=

#+begin_src asm
  .org 0 ; reset vector
  jmp hellworld

  .org 3 ; external interrupt vector (PIN 6)
  retr   ; not used

  .org 7 ; time interrupt vector (msd to lsd)
         ; ...

  .org 0x100
  hellworld: ; ...
  .org 0x300 ; BCD lookup table
#+end_src

*** External Access Mode


- EA input pin, RESET should be applied when EA changes
- disables internal _program memory_ (the first ~1k of the memory map)
- allowing the first words of _program memory_, to be fetched from external memory
- bumps _program memory_ size upto 4k

** Arithmetic Section

  - =Instruction Decoder=
    - stores the ~OP code~ part of the instruction
    - sends control signals to the ALU
  - =ALU=
    - 2x 8bit input
    - 8 bit output
    - sets Carry Flag on ~Program Status Word~
    - Operations:
      - add with/out carry, inc, dec
      - AND, OR, XOR
      - bit complement, rotation, swap nibbles, BCD decimal adjust
  - =Accumulator= register
    - 8 bit
    - one of the ALU sources
    - data to/from I/O ports and memory pass through it (?)

** I/O 27 pins

*** Types of data tranfers

1) Programmed: controlled by the _program_
   - control-> ->signal <-data->
   - inneficient use of CPU
   - there is abit chit-chat needed for reading data
     + you signal/ask for the conversion to happen to the A/D converter
     + wait for it to be ready on T0 (maybe thousands of status signals)
     + accept the data

2) Interrupt: initiated by the _device_ when is ready, through an INTerruption
   - temporarilly suspends normal operations, and transfer the data
   - _more efficient_ than programming
   - useful for events of _unpredictable_ occurrence
   - requires more _hardware complexity_ on the IO, to externally compare and trigger the INTerruption
   - no idle time
     - you send a signal
     - keep processing
     - accept data when INTerrupted

3) DMA Direct Memory Access: between _device_ and the computer _memory_
   - no involvement at all by the CPU
   - needs a _DMA controller_ IC
   - =NOT AVAILABLE for the 8048=

*** Types of I/O operations

1) Control: IO <=  CPU, causes IO to perform an *action* (eg: rewind tape)
2) Status:  IO  => CPU, convey *information* about the present state or condition (eg: parity error)
3) Data:    IO <=> CPU, through data lines on the CPU bus

*** 3 bit test INPUTs for jumps

- T0, T1, INT
- Can be used to monitor external signals

*** 8 bit port (x2)

- TTL compatible IO
- you can mix input and output within a port
- output _latched_ (aka remains until new data is written)
  #+begin_src asm
    outl p1,a ; port 1 = accumulator
    outl p2,a ; port 2 = accumulator
  #+end_src
- input _non-latched_
  #+begin_src asm
    in a,p1 ; accumulator = port 1 state
    in a,p2 ; accumulator = port 2 state
  #+end_src

*** 8 bit bus

- all pins must be used for either input or output (no mixing possible)
- also use the accumulator for I/O
- used for address and data
- needs a transparent latch (373/573) IC for addresses
- bus (=OUTL= and =INS=)
  - configurations
    1) bidirectional (true)
       - with IO strobe pins (RD, WR)
    2) statically non-latched input
    3) statically latched output

  - Early Intel processors combine the address and data bits onto the same lines and use two signals:
    1) ALE  (Address Latch Enable)
    2) PSEN (Program Store Enable)
  - To signal what state the bus is in.
  - This was done to save costs and keep pin count down.
  - Unfortunately this complicates the connection to an external PROM.

  - 74HC573 address latch
  - AT28C64E-15PC
- ROM programmed at factory
- but if you tie EA (External Access input) pin high
  - it can work with external ROM
  - by using 1 address and 1 data bus pin

- $ asm48 -o foo.bin foo.asm

- Comment
  - I tied EA pin 7 to ground to use internal ROM running with a 10Mhz crystal.
  - I see what you mean with getting the CPU to reset reliably, a 2k2 resistor to VCC with a 10uf cap to gnd seems to work ok, boots reliably on power-up.
  - The devices I have are NEC types programmed with an equally ancient Expro-60 device programmer using an ISO interface card. Indeed a lot of fun, regards.
