* image sensors

- a grid of photodiodes (a one way valve for electrons)

** CCD

- readout hapens one row at the time

- video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsdmt0De8Hw][CCD: The heart of a digital camera (how a charge-coupled device works)]]
  - row shifting is done to avoid artifacts

  - immediate predeccessor:
    - BBD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket-brigade_device
    - for audio delays
    - using capacitors
  - CCD = light sensitive BBD
    - by rows, still used in fax machines
    - matrix of photosensitive cells, still working one column at the time
    - shifted out one row at the time
  - explains "bloom effect"
** CMOS

- read out happens at the local sensor
