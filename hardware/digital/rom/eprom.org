#+TITLE: EPROM (71)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM

- Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory
- Erased by strong UV light source (eg: mercury vapor lamp)
- Programmed at higher voltages that the ones that it normally operates
- Generations
  1) 1702 (1971)
     - p-MOS
     - 256 bytes
  2) 2704/2708 (1975)
     - n-MOS
     - 1KB
  3) 2716/2716 (1977)
     - n-MOS
     - removed VBB and VDD pins
  4) 27Cxx (1979)
     - c-MOS
     - where xx started from 32
     - and 10 or 100 mean 1Mbit

  - Universal ROM Programmer build https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Njj9WL8poFKFq03qnmonrOxVDG5TOT6
    - MIC2288 - 1A, 1.2MHz PWM Boost Converter
      - switching boost regulator (not a linear regulator)
      - "All the regulator does is PWM a MOSFET inside the IC.
         Connected to the SW(itch) pin and either charges or floats the _external_ inductor (L1)
         at a frequency of 1.2MHz at a variable duty cycle."

  - Code in Python
  - With a 1MHz clock is fine

  - Data lines are noted On, because they are normally output
  - Vpp = Voltage for programming
    - In video are 25v for programming
    - otherwise 5v when reading or in standby
  - UV light creates a path to GND to discharge it
    - which sets all in high(1)
  - 16:20 writting/programming
    - require pin toggle of 25v by exactly 50ms on VPP
