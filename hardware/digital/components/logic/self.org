- NOT = tied NAND
- AND = NAND + tied NAND
-  OR = 3 NAND
- NOR = 3 NAND + tied nAND

#+CAPTION: logic gates build from NOR
[[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Electronic/ietron/nor2.gif]]

- NOT = tied NOR
- OR = NOR + tier NOR
- AND = 2tied + NOR

- ME: After a "NAND/NOR expansion" it could be that it can be further simplified to less gates than you started with.

- MUX - Multiplexores
  - Output: 1 output
  - Input
    - 1 CLOCK
    - N individual input channels/pins
    - N selection input pins, in binary
  - Daisy Chained
    - by OR-ing the output
    - tying common selection inputs, with inputs
    - and with input MSB split to each ENABLE with/without a NOT
  - IC: 74150/1, 74157 (bus)
  - TIP: can be used to replace logic gates, by mocking a truth table

- Codificadores: dec -> binary
- Decodificadores: binary -> decimal
  - INPUT: parallel, a number in binary
  - OUTPUT: a pin per possible decimal number
  - ICs: 74154, 7442, 74138
  - TIP: can be used to save on using logic gates, by hooking desired outputs to an OR
  - TIP: ENABLE input pin can also be used to daisy chain multiple deco
    - MSB to ENABLE and not(ENABLE)

    - simplification to NAND/NOR
    - derived from De Morgan (?)
    - works for any N of inputs
    - by adding 2 bubbles in a line
    - by transforming to NAND/NOR

** Experimenting with LEDs (1-3)

- Each LED color has
  - different voltage range (?
  - same current requirement (within the voltage range)

- Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)
  - the voltage drops across every component has to be zero
  - if we put 1 component that component has to consume 5v
  - In the example, a 155ohm resistor would drop 3.1v of the circuit.
    - Leaving the LED with 1.9v.
    - It needs 20mA
    - In reality we use a 220ohm (RRB)
    - If we put an 1k (BbR) it will be a bit dimmer.
      With less current consumption.

** Connecting to a Mystery signal (4-)



* Logic Families

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_family
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TpLYx1iZD4

- Both 5v
- Output level for high signal
  - TTL: 2.4v-
  - CMOS: 3.5-
- We can combine them as long as CMOS drives TTL
- TTL pulls his inputs high ?

** TTL  (63) - Transistor Transistor Logic

- Logic family build from Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT)
- 7400 series originally build on it
- still used as "glue logic" interfacing between more densely integrated components
- consumes more power than CMOS
- faster gate logic than CMOS

** CMOS (67) - Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

- A type of MOSFET that uses complementary and symetricall pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETS.
- 99% of ICs were made using CMOS
- high noise immunity
- low static power consuption

** NMOS (N-type Metal Oxide Semiconductor)

- uses ~n-type~ MOSFETs to implement logic gates.
- NMOS AND-by-default logic can produce unusual glitches or buggy behaviour, such as 6502 "illegal opcodes"
- in the 70's faster than CMOS
- high power consumption
