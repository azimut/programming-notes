|--------+--------+---------------|

- (Modified) Harvard Architecture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Harvard_architecture
  - loose separation between code and data
  - _allows memory that contains instructions to be accesed as data_

- 11MHz (divided by 15 internally?)
- 8 bit data
- 96 instructions
  - 1 byte are those that only have the opcode (80%?) (aka operate)
  - 2 bytes are immediate instructions
  - 2 bytes are memory reference intructions

** Timer

- 8bit binary counter (0x00 - 0xFF)
- on overflow:
  - sets a flag flip-flop
    - can be _test_ with ~JTF~ instruction
    - can be _reset_ with ~JFT~ instruction or RST(4) pin
  - if timer interrupt is enabled
    - generates an interruption request
    - calling subroutine in addr 7
    #+begin_src asm
      en  tcnti ;  enable timer counter interrupt
      dis tcnti ; disable timer counter interrupt (also removes it)
    #+end_src

- start/stop
  #+begin_src asm
    strt t    ; start as a TIMER, counts the internal clock = cycle clock / 32
    strt cnt  ; start as a event COUNTER, counts T1 changes (aka external events), set to 255 acts as a second INT
    stop tcnt ; stop any, also by RST
  #+end_src

- set/initialized through the accumulator
  #+begin_src asm
    mov t, a ; timer = acc
    mov a, t ; acc   = timer
  #+end_src

*** unconditional jump & call instruction

- instruction
  - 8 bit opcode
    - 5 bit for opcode
    - 3 bit MSB address
    - there is an _unique opcode for each page_ that a jump or call can transfer control to
  - 8 bit address

- replace 11 bits of the ~program counter~
  - transfer control anywhere within a 2K address range
    - 4 pages of external program memory
    - 4 pages of resident program memory

***   conditional jump instructions

- can transfer control only _within the page_ containing the instruction
- use 2(two) bytes
  - 1(one) for the opcode/instruction
  - 1(one) for the adddress
    - replaces the LSB of the ~program counter~

** ROM

- 1K internal for _program memory_
  - segmented into 4(four) 256-byte blocks/pages
- 3k of additional support for external ROM for _program memory_
- 4k of total ROM supported

*** Program Memory

- 1024 words 8bit wide addressed by the =program counter=

#+begin_src asm
  .org 0 ; reset vector, ->RST(4)
  jmp hellworld

  .org 3 ; external interrupt vector, ->INT(6)
  retr   ; if not used

  .org 7 ; time interrupt vector (msd to lsd)
         ; ...

  .org 0x100
  hellworld: ; ...
  .org 0x300 ; BCD lookup table
#+end_src

*** External Access Mode

- EA(7) input pin
- disables internal _program memory_ (the original first ~1k of the memory map)
- allowing the first words of _program memory_, to be fetched from external memory
- bumps _program memory_ size upto 4k
- RST(4) should be applied when EA(7) changes
- External _Instruction_ *FETCH* Cycle
  - automatically if memory address >1024 OR EA(7) pin is on
  - ~program counter~ put
    - 8bit bus
    - 4bit port 2
  - ALE(11) indicates address validity timing
    - Address Latch Enable - connect to a 373 latch control
    - for both external program and external data memory
  - PSEN(9) indicates program fetching is in progress
    - Program Store ENable
    - tie it to CE/OE of the memory
  - bus is reset (? and content is read

** RAM

- RAM addresses can't be accessed directly, do it through @R0 or @R1
- Vdd(26) provides power when Vcc(40) is powered off
- Can be expanded to access 256 bytes extra of external _data memory_
  - 64+256 = 320 bytes

*** External Data Memory addressing

- =movx= allows upto 256 new memory locations (added to the 64 internal)
- additional pages may be added by bank switching with extra output lines (?)

#+begin_src asm
  movx   a, @r0 ;   a = *r0
  movx @r0, a   ; *r0 = a

  movx   a, @r1 ;   a = *r1
  movx @r1, a   ; *r1 = a
#+end_src

*** Internal Data Memory layout

- (0-31) Lower Half
  - (0-7) 8 (working) registers of 8bit
    - R0-R7 - aka memory bank 0
    - =Register Inderect Addressing=
      - R0/R1 may be used as *RAM pointers* to access memory containing data.
        #+begin_src asm
          mov a, @r0 ; a = *r0
        #+end_src
  - (8-23) 8-Level (program counter) stack
    - 16x8
    - addressed by the stack pointer during subroutine calls
    - 8 stack locations in 16 RAM locations (2 locations per address)
    - each will contain:
      - 11 the ~program counter~
      - 4 of the ~PSW~ (the MSB of it)
  - (24-31) 0x18-0x1F Optional second register stack
    - R0'-R7' - aka memory bank 1
    - can be used in place of R0-R7
    - useful during interrupts
    - see ~program status word~

- (32-64) Upper Half
  - 32x8
  - Data Store
    - up to the programmer
    - accessed only by R0, R1

** Arithmetic Section
*** Instruction Decoder
- stores the ~OP code~ part of the instruction
- sends control signals to the ALU
*** ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- 2x 8bit input
  - 8 bit accumulator
  - 8 bit temporary register (transparent)
- 8 bit output
- sets a =Carry Flag= on the ~Program Status Word~ on overflow
- Operations:
  - add with/out carry, incr, decr
  - AND, OR, XOR
  - bit complement, rotation, swap nibbles, BCD decimal adjust
*** Accumulator register
- 8 bit
- one of the ALU sources
- data to/from I/O ports and memory pass through it
** I/O (BUS,PS1,PS2,T0,T1,INT)

- 27 pins in total (8+8+8+1+1+1)
- 1 bit ones
  - they can be used to monitor external signals
  - branching/condjumps without loading an input port into the ~accumulator~

*** Types of data tranfers

1) Programmed: controlled by the _program_
   - control-> ->signal <-data->
   - inneficient use of CPU
   - there is abit chit-chat needed for reading data
     1) you signal/ask for the conversion to happen to the A/D converter
     2) wait for it to be ready on T0 (maybe thousands of status signals)
     3) accept the data

2) Interrupt: initiated by the _device_ when is ready, through an INTerruption
   - temporarilly suspends normal operations, and transfer the data
   - _more efficient_ than programming
   - useful for events of _unpredictable_ occurrence
   - requires more _hardware complexity_ on the IO, to externally compare and trigger the INTerruption
   - no idle time
     - you send a signal
     - keep processing
     - accept data when INTerrupted

3) DMA Direct Memory Access: between _device_ and the computer _memory_
   - no involvement at all by the CPU
   - needs a _DMA controller_ IC
   - =NOT AVAILABLE for the 8048=

*** Types of I/O operations

1) Control: CPU → IO, causes IO to perform an *action* (eg: rewind tape)
2) Status:  CPU ← IO, convey *information* about the present state or condition (eg: parity error)
3) Data:    CPU ↔ IO, through data lines on the CPU bus

*** 1 bit INT(6)

#+begin_src asm
  en  i ;  enables interrupts
  dis i ; disables interrupts
#+end_src

- disabled on RST
- is active low, to allow logic ORing of several ones
- sampled every instruction cycle
- can be tested with ~JNI~ to test a pending interrupts before enable them
  - if kept disable can be seen as a new ~T2~
- must be held for at least 3 machine cycles to ensure proper a interrupt
- must be removed before ~RETR~
  - peripherical devices (ics?) automatically disable the interrupt when a register is read on it
  - you might output and interrupt ack
- single level, once triggered all further ones are ignored until ~RETR~

*** 1 bit T0(1)

#+CAPTION: reading of T0 with "ent0 clk" done
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./DeMon48_128k_G_LA_ENT0_CLK.png]]

- use cases
  - as a test input
  - to OUTPUT periodical sequence of pulses
    - to be used externally as reference for other devices
    - used internally to generate the S1-S5 machine cycles
    #+begin_src asm
      ent0 clk ; output clock/3 on T0
    #+end_src

*** 1 bit T1(39)

- uses
  - test input
  - or INPUT to an event counter

*** 8 bit port (x2)

- P1 & P2 ports
  - LSB of P2 are used as addresses for external program memory access
- TTL compatible IO
- you can mix input and output within a port (aka quasi-bidirectional)
- output _latched_ (aka remains until new data is written, pull resistor of 50kΩ)
  #+begin_src asm
    outl p1,a ; port 1 = accumulator
    outl p2,a ; port 2 = accumulator
  #+end_src
- input _non-latched_
  #+begin_src asm
    in a,p1 ; accumulator = port 1 state
    in a,p2 ; accumulator = port 2 state
  #+end_src

*** 8 bit bus (12-19)

#+begin_src asm
  outl bus, a   ; bus = acc(umulator)
  ins    a, bus ; acc = bus
#+end_src

- all pins must be used for either input or output (no mixing possible)
- used for addresses (LSB 8 bits) and data r/w
  - needs a transparent latch (373/573) IC for addresses
- configurations
  1) bidirectional (true)
     - with IO strobe pins: RD(8) and WR(10)
  2) statically non-latched INPUT
  3) statically latched OUTPUT

* gotchas

- critique
  - mcs-48 was originally designed as a 2kb machine, with a second 2kb capability added as a clumsy afterthought. Creating 2 problems with the addressing mechanism.
    - the _program counter_ is really 11 bits, thus address JMP/CALL instructions possible within 2kb bank of program store
      - the internal MB register flag
      - SEL MB0
      - SEL MB1
      - since you can't know the value of the flag on JMP/CALL , do not them on interruption code
    - 2k memory banks are divided in 256 byte pages
      - conditional jumps specify an 8bit target address _in the current page_
    - lack of codition codes for testing their rsults
      - only the accumulator can be tested for zero or negative
      - no overflow bit (harder comparison of signed two-complement)

  - Early Intel processors combine the address and data bits onto the same lines and use two signals:
    1) ALE  (Address Latch Enable)
    2) PSEN (Program Store Enable)
  - To signal what state the bus is in.
  - This was done to save costs and keep pin count down.
  - Unfortunately this complicates the connection to an external PROM.

- YT Comments
  - I tied EA pin 7 to ground to use internal ROM running with a 10Mhz crystal.
  - I see what you mean with getting the CPU to reset reliably, a 2k2 resistor to VCC with a 10uf cap to gnd seems to work ok, boots reliably on power-up.
  - The devices I have are NEC types programmed with an equally ancient Expro-60 device programmer using an ISO interface card. Indeed a lot of fun, regards.

**** Example 1: infinite loop of NOPs
#+begin_src asm
    .org 0x0
    reset:

          anl   A, #0x80        ; 0b10000000 checks if high bit is set

          jnz buton_not_pressed

          ;; button is pressed
          mov R0, #0xFE         ; 0b11111110 drive P1.0 low, LED is on

* MCS-41 - UPI-41 - 8041/8042

#+begin_src
  NOTE: I own a couple of 8042 so I am making a special section for them.
#+end_src

- 1979
- 8-bit slave microcontroller
  - a MCU with a slave interface
  - interface registers
  - DMA support
- UPI-(C¦L)42 Universal Peripherical Interface
- use cases:
  - keyboard control
  - ADC control
- Can use a 8243 IO expander
- Followed by 8742

- Many dissimilar pins to the 8048
  - *XTAL1(2)* can act as a single clock input if we are following a _master chip_
  - D0-D7 have no dual purpose of communicate addresses besides data
  - P1 pins communicates the addresses
  - DMA suport with *P2_6(37)* for DRQ and *P2_7(38)* for DACK#
  - *RD#(8)* and *WR#(10)* are INPUTS from the _master chip_ to enable either
    - not OUTPUT probes like in 8048
    - no support for extended SRAM (?
  - new *A_0(9)* input from the _master chip_ to indicate if it is tranfering data or a command
  - new *SYNC(11)* output clock signal which occurs once per cycle (works as an ALE?)
  - no *INT(6)* pin

- Second Sources:
  - D80C42C by NEC
    - no *A20GATE(22)* support (?)
    - no *Vdd(26)* pin
    - new *STOP* instruction and INPUT pin *#(26)* to enable a _STOP mode_
      - for lower power consumption
      - stops the oscillator
      - keeps ram powered
      - lowers voltage
        - to 2.0v if done by pin
        - to 2.5v if done by instruction
    - new *HALT* instruction for a _HALT mode_
      - for low power consumption
      - keeps the oscillator active
      - internal clock stops
      - reset by *TEST0(1)* and *RST#(4)*

- tool:
  - any 8048 asm should work, except for instructions that don't
