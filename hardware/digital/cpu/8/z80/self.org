  - Z80 is a NMOS which is half CMOS (?), uses MOSFETs and those gate "float", so is better to tie them low/high.
  - Micro-processors do NOT have internal memory.
    Unlike Micro-controllers.
  - Micro-processors also are NOT mean to drive LEDs loads. Unlike Micro-controllers.
  - Hooks DATA bits to zero with 1k. AKA NOP.
    - Also tries an ADD to have an instruction that takes more cycles
  - Hooks ADDRESS lines to leds.
  - puts leds on other signals
    - write,read,mreq
