- synchoronous
- full-duplex serial
- asymetrical communication
  - master/slave
  - controlled by the MCU
- simpler han I2C
  - can be bitbanged
- no spec
- used by:
  - some serial EEPROMS (see flashrom)
  - sdcards

* pins

[[./spi-pinout.png]]

- 3/4 pins:
  - SS/CS: "slave select", from the MCU
    - useful to re-use the same MOSI/MISO connections
  - SCLK: "slave clock" from the MCU
    - 1 bit of data per clock, on both MOSI/MISO
  - MOSI/SDI/DIN
    - Master Out Slave In
    - Serial Data In
    - Data In
  - MISO/SDO
    - Master In Slave Out
    - Serial Data Out
    - Can be missing (eg: on a display)
