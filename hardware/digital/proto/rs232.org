- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232
  - 1960
  - Still used in short-range, point-to-point, low-speed  wired connections.
  - Standard between DTE and DCE
    - DTE - Data Terminal Equipment (eg: pc)
    - DCE - Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment (eg: modem)
  - RS-232
    - "Recommended Standard 232"
    - aka TIA-232

- "Console" ports on Routers are actually Serial ports (!)

- Names defined from DTE's POV

- Standard spec used 25 pins
  - has a "secondary" serial data channel pins
  - has 3 pins for clocks
  - irl were mostly unused

- Manufacturers ended up using 9 pin connectors
  - aka =TIA-574=
  - *Does NOT include a clock* to tell us where each bit is
  - time divisions is given by choosen *baudrate*
    - baud = symbols per second (with a bit is a symbol)
    - uses first bit to resync clocks, aka =start bit=
    - and last bit low, the =stop bit=
  - to send a packet we need at least 10/11 bits
    - 1 start bit
    - 8 data
    - 1 optional parity bit
    - 1 stop bit

- MAX232 - Dual EIA-232 Driver/Receiver
  - has a =charge pump=
    - you need to provide the 1uF capacitors
  - to generate supply voltages for TIA-232
    - +5v -5v
  - from 5v
