- 1986

- uses a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_cable][ribbon cable]] (aka cable cinta)
  - "From a digital point of view, ribbon cable was an ideal way to connect two devices. However, from an analog point of view, these cables are problematic."

- 40, 44 or 80 conductor cables
  - 80
    - required for UDMA5/6
    - new conductors were inverleaved GNDs, reducing capacitance coupling
