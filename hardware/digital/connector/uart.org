  - async serial communication
  - common signal levels are:
    - RS-232
    - RS-422?
    - RS-485
    - raw TTL (for short debugging links)
  - simple protocol
  - can be emulated by bit-banging GPIO pins in software

- On Linux to access /dev/ttyUSB0 your used needs to be in *dialout* group

* Chips

- CH340 (not recommended? low clock accuraccy)
- CP2102/9 by Sillicon Labs
  - I own 3 (red) boards
- PL-2303HX by Prolific
  - I own 1 board
- FT232BL by FTDI
  - i own 1 ic

* How to find UART?

- 20 video with example boards images [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01mw0oTHwxg][Hacker's Guide to UART Root Shells]]
- unpluggeed
  - measure continuity/resistance
  - against *GND* and *Vcc*, it will be 0(zero)
- plugged
  - measure voltage
  - connect a probe to GND
  - *TX* pin, on boot, will oscillate between 3.3v and 0v
  - *RX* pin, should have a stable voltage, since is waiting for input

* Connecting

- try [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port#Speed][common baud rates]] : 115200, 9600, 57600, 38400, 19200
- to use them with an adaptor
  - connect TX,RX,GND
    - RX on adapter to TX on the board
    - TX on adapter to RX on the board
  - do NOT connect Vcc
