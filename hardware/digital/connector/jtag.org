  - Join Task/Test Action Group
  - 1990 (Intel 80486)
  - Implemented on ICs
  - a way to interface and diagnosticate production issues
  - not fast (boundary scans are bitshifted by design)
  - boundary scans
    - around a chip
    - can be extended to many other components/ics through its bitshifting nature
    - can be skipped through physical jumpers
  - NEEDS A BSDL TO READ
    - Boundary Scan Description Language
    - describes what each pin does, description ID of each chip
  - Goals
    - Controlability: set 0 and 1 internal memory
    - Observability: read internal memory registers
  - Can
    - boundary scan (aka testing pin connectivity)
    - rw EEPROM (aka program)
    - in-circuit debugging (aka control)
    - daisy chain multiple ics
    - break into boot cycle

  - opencd opens a gdb server port
    #+begin_src sh
      $ opencd -f ft232h.cfg -f raspi.cfg
    #+end_src
  - use gdb-multiarch to connect to it
    #+begin_src sh
      $ gdb-multiarch  ./blink-led.elf
      gdb> set arch arm
      gdb> target extended-remote localhost:3333
      gdb> x10i 0xc0136dd4 # show 10 instructions on given memory
