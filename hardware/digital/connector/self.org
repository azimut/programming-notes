- Circuit: switching higher voltages
  - eg: using a MOSFET (logic level type)
    - still might need a resistor a 1k, to avoid problem when doing PWM
  - eg: using a BJT
    - R = V/I = (5v-0.6v)/10mA = 440 ohm
    - Vdrop = 0.6v
    - having the transistor a gain of 100x
    - we want a max current of 1A
