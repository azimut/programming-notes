- Circuit: switching higher voltages
  - eg: using a MOSFET (logic level type)
    - still might need a resistor a 1k, to avoid problem when doing PWM
  - eg: using a BJT
    - R = V/I = (5v-0.6v)/10mA = 440 ohm
    - Vdrop = 0.6v
    - having the transistor a gain of 100x
    - we want a max current of 1A

- Circuit: 5v -> 3.3v (Voltage divider)
  - R1 1k omh
  - R2 2k omh

- Circuit: 5v <-> 3.3v [[http://jamgo.org.uk/electronics/BiDirectional_Logic_Level_Converter.note.html][Bi-directional Level Conversion]]
  - Low side: 3.3v GPIO pin
  - High side: 5v IO
  - eg: needed for I2C
