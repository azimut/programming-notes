- You can think of a transistors as
  - switches
  - current amplifiers
  - a variable resistors.
    - That varies trying to match the *current* in the base
    - With the *current* in the collectorx100 (times one hundred)

- There are 2 current that could flow through a transistor
  - Base Current (Ib)
  - Collector Current (Ic)

- States
  - Saturation: when there is current in base
  - Cutoff: when there is no current in base

- You can build 2 types of circuits, depending where the OUTPUT is placed (before or after transitor)
  1) emitter follower (aka buffer)
  2) inverter

* Classification
** FET (Field Effect Transistor)

[[https://i.ytimg.com/vi/euXR2blqlDE/maxresdefault.jpg]]

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor
- 1925/195-
- aka "unipolar transistors"
- voltage controlled
- Uses an ~electric field~ to control the flow of current in a semiconductor.
- terminals/legs
  1) source
  2) gate: control the flow of current by applying voltage here, which alters the conductivity
  3) drain

***   JFET (Junction FET)

- in ~N-type~ applying negative voltage in gate would increase depletion region

*** MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET)

- a block of ~P-type~ with probes of ~N-type~ (in N-type transistors)
- a metal gate layer above a insulating oxide layer
- when a (+) is given to the gate,
  it pulls electrons making the whole middle section N-type
  closing the circuit

** BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistors)

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor
- The most common
- Uses both *electrons* and *electron holes* as charge carriers.
- Can work as a current controlled switch
- Multiplies (~100x) current (the Betha)
- Types: NPN, PNP
- Legs: emitter, collector, base
