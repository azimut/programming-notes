- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode

- one-way valves for electricity
- from Anode to Cathode (aka forward direction/biased)
  1) one carries current by electrons
  2) another one through holes, where electrons are missing

- Specs
  - Forward Voltage: =Vf=
  - Max Switching Speed: in ns (eg: 4ns ~100Khz)
  - Breakdown: ~-50v

- ideal diodes will
  - acts as an _opencircuit_ any and all current in reverse
  - acts as a _shortcircuit_ (no resistance) when current is forward
    - irl has a Vf (forward voltage drop) ~13% ~0.7v
    - aka don't conduct below a certain threshold input *voltage* (~0.7v)
    - Power (in watts) = =Vf= (in Volts) * I (in amps)
    - as such, is not reliable to put diodes in parallel (1 does all the work)

- operating regions of a diode
  1) Forward: voltage is positive, greater than Vf, current run through
  2) Reverse: =Vbr= > voltage > =Vf=
  3) Breakdown: voltage is negative

* Diode IV Equation (for positive voltage)

#+begin_src
  i = Is * (e^(q*Vd/kT) - 1))
#+end_src

- Is = saturation current, (eg: sillicon 10^-12 Amp, 1pA)
- q  = charge of an electron = 1.602*10^-19 Coloumb
- Vd = Voltage on the diode
- k  = Voltzmann constant = 1.38*10^-23 Joules/Kelvin
- T  = Temperature in Kelvin

* Circuits / Usages
- Polarity Protection: for an upside-down battery
- Battery Backup:
  - with 2 diodes
  - if power supply voltage > battery voltage

** AC-DC Convertor

- to convert AC to DC, letting through only the positive voltage

- half-way rectification
  - dumb with a diode+capacitor
  - ripple being the range of voltage variation under load X
  - ripple causes the "humm" in audio
  - Vripple = I/(2*f*C)
    - f is frequency of AC
    - C is capacitance

- full-wave rectification:
  - when transformer has center tapping (GND)
  - needs 2 diodes
  [[https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/full-wave-center-tap-rectifier-schematic-diagram.jpg]]

- full-wave rectification ~bridge rectifier~
  - for when the transformer does NOT have center tapping (GND)
  - needs 4 diodes
  - allows using both negative and positive voltage
  - no matter input polarity current will output in 1 direction
  - add a capacitor and you have it rectified again

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snubber][snubber]] / [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode][flyback]] / commutating / freewheeling / supressor / clamp / catch

- aka to suppress transient voltages
- aka reverse voltage protection
- to eliminate flyback (aka sudden voltage spikes) of an inductor/motor/solenoid (eg: when switching off)

** Voltage Clipper

- to remove either or both sides of a voltage

** DC-DC convertor

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_converter][buck convertor]] aka step-down convertor
  - decreses voltage while increasing current
  - switch is usually a transistor (MOSFET)
  - but IRL an LM2596 is used instead
  - more efficient than a linear voltage convertor
