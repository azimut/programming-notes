- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor
- BLDC
- synchronous
- DC
- intended for continuos rotation
- 3/4 output wires, 1 for each phase
- 3/4 coils & phases, tied together in a "neutral point"
  - coils generate heat
  - wirings: DLKR winding
- has to be driven by an =ESC= (Electronic Speed Controller)
  - since there is no a _commutator_ to control when to change polarities
  - speed is controlled by an input PWM at 50Hz
  - uses 2 MOSFETs per phase
  - need to know the orientation of the motor
    - by a Hall Effect Sensor
    - or by Back EMF measured on the not active phase at that moment
- KV Rating: RPM * Volts
- no brushes, no wearing, more rpms
- types by rotation:
  - inrunnner: +speed
  - outrunner: +torque
- Parts
  - Stator:
    - 12 "theeth" made of laminated metal to reduce "eddy currents"
    - 12 coils of enamelled wire, group in 3 sets
