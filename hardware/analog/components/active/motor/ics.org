#+TITLE: Driver ICs

- Phase Sequence https://electrical-engineering-portal.com/proper-phase-sequence-cw-ccw-electric-motors-generators
- Needed due:
  - different *voltage* needs, usually >5v
  - higher *current* needs (>1A) where uC usually are meant to drive ~20mA
- Alternatives:
  - transistors, for unipolar
    - tip122 for each driving line
  - h-bridge, for bipolar driver
    - example arduino https://www.instructables.com/H-Bridge-Motor-Driver-for-Arduino-Using-Transistor/

- DM542T
  - up to 128 microsteps
- L297 - "Stepper Motor Controller"
- L298 - "Dual Full-Bridge Driver"
- L6203
- TMC2208
  - "white" board
- DRV8834 "Dual-Bridge Stepper or DC Motor Driver" https://www.pololu.com/product/21341
  - low voltage 2.2v-10v
  - "purple" board
- A4988 - DMOS Microstepper driver w/translator overcurrent protection
  - "red" board
  - Arduino kit 4x, 12-36v, 2A per IC https://joy-it.net/en/products/Ard-CNC-Kit1
  - configurable to work on 1/2/4/8/16 step modes (through MS1/MS2/MS3 pins)
  - NO phase sequence tables
- SN754410 - Quadruple Half-H Driver
- L293D - Quadruple Half-H Driver
- SMA7023M* - "2-Phase Stepper Motor Unipolar Driver"
  - 10v-44v - Control Supply Voltage - Vs
  - https://www.electro-tech-online.com/threads/regarding-stepper-motors-and-printer-pcb.135821/

* LB1845* (x2) "PWM Current Controlling Stepping Motor Driver"

- 10v-44v (Vbb) Motor Supply
- 5v (Vcc) Logic Supply
- DIP28
- Stepping: done through a "phase sequence table"
  - 8 steps are predefined
  - they should be followed in order
  - order (up/down) dictates the spin orientation
  - cycling through when it ends
  - each step corresponds to an state for each of the 6 inputs for the 2 phases
