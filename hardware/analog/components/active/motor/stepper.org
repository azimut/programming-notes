- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor
- brushless DC electric motor
- given a step position
- don't need a position sensor for feedback

- Driving types:
  - bipolar (4 cables)
    - +torque
    - -maxspeed
    - voltage polarity reversal
  - unipolar (5,6 cables)
    - -torque
    - +maxspeed
    - no voltage polarity reversal
    - needs at least 5 cables
    - 1 extra for a tap to the center of a pair of coils

- Shafts: round, D, geared, lead-screw

- Drivers:
  - L/R (aka constant voltage)
  - Chopper

- Inductance:
  - in millihenries
  - higher means less maxspeed

- Microstepping:
  - affects max velocity
