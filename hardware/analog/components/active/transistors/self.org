- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor

- 1957 (first commercially available)
- based on semiconductors changes of conductivity
- Similar to a *diode* (aka PN), but with an extra element
  - Uses both *electrons* and *electron holes* as charge carriers.
- You can think of a transistors as
  - switches
  - current amplifiers
  - a variable resistors

- Types
  - MOSFET
    - P-Channel - MOSFET
      - For power polarity protection
      - Without much Vdrop
  - BJT (Bipolar Juntion Transistor)
    - PNP / NPN
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMOS_logic][PMOS]] (60) -> [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic][TTL]] (70) ->  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMOS_logic][NMOS]] (80) -> [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS][CMOS]] (80)
    - p-channel (24v)
    - Transistor-Transistor Logic (3.3v)
    - n-type
    - complementary
  - Phototransistor
    - a BJT that instead of base has a light detector
    - the more light, the more current will flow
    - no cadmium, unlike photoresistors
    - TEPT5600
  - Darlington
    - has 2 transistors in 1 package
    - with increases gain
    - and more _voltage drop_ :(
    - darling array = 2NPN + 3res + 2dio

        - very sensible, to detect something
        - slow
        - never 0v

- States
  - =Saturation=: when there is current in base
  - =Cutoff=: when there is no current in base
