- The most common
- =current= controlled switch
- _voltage drop_ of 0.5v
- multiplies/amplifies current by a Betha (~100x) (aka the Current Gain)
  - Betha = Collector_Current / Base_Current

- Legs: emitter, collector, base

- Characteristics:
  - ~Vbe~ base-emitter voltage
    - Most transistors operate at: 0mV < Vbe < 700mV
  - ~Vce~ collector-emitter voltage
  - There are 2 current that could flow through a transistor
    - ~Ib~ Base Current
    - ~Ic~ Collector Current
  - Allows ~Ic~ to flow, when a small ~Ib~ flows

- Types
  - NPN: small current from from B to E, triggers a large current from C to E
  - PNP: a small current from E to B, triggers a bigger current from E to C

- Features
  - +power consumption
  - lower density (harder to fit on a space)
  - more durable
