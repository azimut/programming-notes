- longest is (+), shortest is (-)
- capacity measured in ~mAh~ (milli Amper hour)
  - eg: 2000mAh = 2A for an hour
- in series, add the voltages
- in parallel, DON'T, current will flow between batteries
- different models have [[http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Battery-internal-resistance][different internal resistance]] with same voltage
  - the bigger, the less iR and can give more current

- charging
  - tricke: doesn't work with LiPo
  - MCP73831/2: for LiPo batteries

- ideal battery
  - maintains the same voltage regardless of current serving
  - modeled by imagining an internal resistor inside it
    - that represents the delay in chemical reactions
    - the internal resistance increases as the battery gets old
  - it forms a =voltage divider= with the outside load/resistance
