- longest is (+), shortest is (-)

- different models have [[http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Battery-internal-resistance][different internal resistance]] with same voltage
  - the bigger, the less iR and can give more current
  |-----+-------------+------------|
  | 9-V | zinc carbon | 35Ω        |
  | 9-V | lithium     | 16Ω to 18Ω |
  | 9-V | alkaline    | 1Ω to 2Ω   |
  | AA  | Alkaline    | 0.15Ω      |
  | AA  | NiMH        | 0.02Ω      |

- ideal battery
  - maintains the same voltage regardless of current serving
  - modeled by imagining an internal resistor inside it
    - that represents the delay in chemical reactions
    - the internal resistance increases as the battery gets old
  - it forms a =voltage divider= with the outside load/resistance
