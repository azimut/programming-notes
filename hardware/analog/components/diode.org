- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode

- one-way valves for electricity
- from anode to cathode (aka forward direction)
  1) one carries current by electrons
  2) another one through holes, where electrons are missing

- Specs
  - Forward Voltage: =Vf=
  - Max Switching Speed: in ns (eg: 4ns ~100Khz)

- ideal diodes will
  - acts as an _opencircuit_ any and all current in reverse
  - acts as a _shortcircuit_ (no resistance) when current is forward
    - irl has a Vf (forward voltage drop) ~13% ~0.7v
    - Power (in watts) = =Vf= (in Volts) * I (in amps)
    - as such, is not reliable to put diodes in parallel (1 does all the work)

- don't conduct below a certain threshold input *voltage* (~0.7v)
- operating regions of a diode
  1) Forward: voltage is positive, greater than Vf, current run through
  2) Reverse: =Vbr= > voltage > =Vf=
  3) Breakdown: voltage is negative

* Functions / Setups

1. to convert AC to DC, letting through only the positive voltage
   - dumb with a diode+capacitor (provides half-way rectification)
   - ~bridge rectifier~ (full-way rectification)
     - allows using both negative and positive voltage
     - no matter input polarity current will output in 1 direction
     - add a capacitor and you have it rectified again

2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snubber][snubber]] / [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode][flyback]] / commutating / freewheeling / supressor / clamp / catch
   - aka to suppress transient voltages
   - aka reverse voltage protection
   - to eliminate flyback (aka sudden voltage spikes) of an inductor/motor/solenoid (eg: when switching off)

3. Voltage Clipper
   - to remove either or both sides of a voltage

* Types

- Small Signal: for low electrical current
  - https://www.inventable.eu/2018/03/21/diodo-1n4148/
  - 1N4148 (glass red, switching)
  - 1N5236B
  - 1N1100
  - 1N740
- Rectifier: high electric current
  - 1N4002 (epoxy, rectifier)
- Schottky
- Zener
  - low breakdown voltage
  - in reverse due "zener breakdown"
  - maintains constant voltage

- PhotoVoltaic Cell
  - have a thin N-type layer
  - takes light in and produces electricity

- LED
  - have a thin P-type layer
  - light is created at the junction
