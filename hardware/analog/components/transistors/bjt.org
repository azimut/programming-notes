- http://r-luis.xbot.es/edigital/qnpn_pnp.html
- The most common
- Uses both *electrons* and *electron holes* as charge carriers.
- current controlled switch
- _voltage drop_ of 0.5v
- Multiplies (~100x) current (the Betha)
- Most transistors operate at: 0mV < Vbe < 700mV
- Legs: emitter, collector, base
- There are 2 current that could flow through a transistor
  - ~Ib~ Base Current
  - ~Ic~ Collector Current
- Allows ~Ic~ to flow, when a small ~Ib~ flows
- Similar to a *diode* (aka PN), but with an extra element
- Types
  - NPN: small current from from B to E, triggers a large current from C to E
  - PNP: a small current from E to B, triggers a bigger current from E to C
- Features
  - +power consumption
  - lower density (harder to fit on a space)
  - more durable
