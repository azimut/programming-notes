- has no effect on DC
- stores energy in ~magnetic field~

- cannot have immediate changes of current

- Usages
  - in *power supplies* to convert voltages
    - by alternately storing / releasing energy
    - helping maximize battery life

- =inductance= measured in henry, the higher the more resistance
  - nanohenry ones, will only filter high frequencies (+100Mhz)
    - in radios
  - microhenry ones, 50kHz-2Mhz
    - in dc power supplies
  - millihenry
    - in heavy power filters
    - in audio crossover filters

- _ferrite_ = a ceramic filled with iron oxide
- a _ferrite_ magnetic core increases
  + the magnetic field
  + the energy stored
  + the inductance

- when un/plugged causes a spike in voltage (see diode)
