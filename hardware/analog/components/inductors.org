- has no effect on DC
- stores energy in magnetic form

- cannot have immediate changes of current

- =inductance= measured in henry, the higher the more resistance
  - nanohenry ones, will only filter high frequencies (+100Mhz)
    - in radios
  - microhenry ones, 50kHz-2Mhz
    - in dc power supplies
  - millihenry
    - in heavy power filters
    - in audio crossover filters

- a ferrite magnetic core increases
  - the magnetic field
  - the energy stored
  - the inductance
