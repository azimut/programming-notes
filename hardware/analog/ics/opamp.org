- wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier

- 1941 with vacuum tubes
- 1963 first IC

- Amplifies the difference between the inputs
  - aka V+ minus V-
  - supports both DC and AC
- High gains +100000x
- impedance
  - high INPUT
  - low OUTPUT

- Rules
  1) no ~current~ flows IN or OUT of the inputs (V+, V-)
  2) tries to keep the inputs the same ~voltage~ (only for closed loop)
     it does it with the output feedback

* power supply

1) bipolar/split/dual: -12v,0v,+12v
   - used by hifi audio amplifiers
   - can return negative voltages

2) simple: 0v,+5v
   - Inverting
     - Vout = (2.5-Vin)*(Rf/R1)     + 2.5
   - Non-inverting
     - Vout = (Vin-2.5)*(1+(Rf/R1)) + 2.5
   - used by along digital circuits
   - canNOT return negative voltages (chops it off)

* use cases

- DSP, signal conditioning
- Dual power supply, DAC
- Operation = they were used to peform math operations in analog computers
  - addition
  - subtraction?
  - integration
  - multiplication
  - logarithm
    - in rf carriers, nedded to dynamically adjust gain ans o maximize SNR over a wide dynamic range of received inputs on carriers at Mhz or GHz
  - differentiation?
    - it takes the difference between inputs and amplifies it?

*   open loop

- gain is typically around 100k (not practical)
- it's easy for the OUTPUT to get saturated
  - as such it can be used as comparator (poor's man)

* closed loop

- We need additional circuitry because we are using them for reasons werent designed for
- We give it a ~negative feedback~
- The higher Rf, the higher the gain

- Configurations

  1) (Unity Gain) Buffer:
     - tied Vout and V- input
     - special case of 2) with no resistance

  2) Non Inverting Amplifier: signal goes into V+
     - GAIN = Av = Rf/Ri + 1
       Rf feedback resistor
       Ri   ground resistor

  3) Inverting Amplifier: signal goes into V-
     - You are NEVER going to get a negative OUTPUT voltage
       - if you have a single supply power?
     - Creates a ~virtual ground~ after R1
     - GAIN = Av = -Rf/R1
