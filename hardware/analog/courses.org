** 1 Electricity and Electronics

- =Electronics=
  - involves the *control* of one ~electrical circuit~
  - by another

- =Electrical Circuit=
  - is an interconnection of *components*
  - intented to do something useful.

- Both vacuum tubes and transistors
  - allows one electronic circuit to *control* another
  - transistors being "solid state" devices
  [[https://cs.calvin.edu/activities/books/rit/chapter2/images/transhist.gif]]

- 1946 First Computer (ENIAC), had 20k vacuum tubes.

- Electric Power
  - in Watts
  - P = I*V

** 2 Circuits and Symbols

- simplest circuit = battery + resistor

** 3 Instruments and Measurement

#+begin_src
  voltage <-> across
  current <-> through
#+end_src

- volts don't go through anything
  - they aren't a flow
  - they are the potential of difference across 2 points

- Voltmeter (measure voltage)
  - ideal ones should have infinite resistance to affect less measurements, through which current cannot flow
    - analogs have 20k ohms
    - digitals have 1M,10M ohms
  - we put it in *parallel* with what we want to measure
    #+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
      [[https://buphy.bu.edu/~duffy/PY106/Voltmeter.GIF]]

- Ampmeter (Measure current)
  - ideal one should have zero resistance
  - put it in series / break the circuit

- Ohmmeter (measure resistance)
  - you to be more "active", generate a current
  - you need to disconnect it from the circuit

** 4 AC vs DC

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
#+CAPTION: AC to DC, simple power supply
[[https://www.homemade-circuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/power2Bsupply2Bcircuit2Busing2Bsingle2Bdiode.png]]

- DC from batteries, constant
- AC from power outlet, time varying
  - easier to step down/up voltage
  - characteristics
    + peak amplitude/voltage
    + rms (root-mean-square) amplitude/voltage
    + period: time for one full cycle
    + frequency: number of cycles per second (Hz)
  - in US: 120v, 60Hz powerlines (peak 170v, rms 120v)

** 5 Up the Trebble, Down the Bass

- aka filter circuits (with capacitors)
- project TODO: twin-t filter / notch filter
  [[http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/images/Twin-t-notch-filter.png]]

** 6 Semiconductors

- sillicon acts as semiconductor
  - every sillicon atom is bind to his neighbours by 2 electrons
  - at room temperature one of the 2 electrons might leave
  - creating ~holes~ (aka missing electrons) on it
  - the holes give the conductivity

- most semiconductors are doped sillicon
  - added impurities/dopants (eg: phosphorus, boron)
  - resulting in ~N-type~ and ~P-type~ semiconductors
  - depending if electro(N)s or (P)ositive holes carry the current

- =PN Junction= (aka diode)
  [[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/imgsol/pn2.png]]
   - a P-type+N-type semiconductor
  - leaves the junction with few free charges (aka _bad conductor_)
    - a =depletion region/zone=
    - which can be temporarily removed, with a battery in the right polarity aka *forward bias*

- Types of diodes: zener, photovoltaicell, led

** 7 Transistors: How they work

- FET(MOS,J), BJT
- BJT(NPN,PNP)

** 8 Transistors: as amplifiers

- Common Emitter Amplifier
  - load line analysis (?
    - there is a cutoff of a max input voltage we can receive before cutting off the amplified signal
  - needs biasing circuit or diode on transistor won't work
    - with resistors carefully selected
    - provides current even when there is no other input current
    - input
      - needs to be really small
      - coupled with a capacitor, to block direct current (DC can't get through it)
      - out of phase with the output
  - an extra resistor (50ohms) on the emitter lead gives a better bias
    - protects transistor
    - less distortion
    - give you a fixed gain
    - an capacitor in parallel with it would also help

** TODO 9 Building an Audio Amplifier

- 2-stage common-emitter amplifier
  - stage 2 is basically a copy of stage 1
  - in between a capacitor
  - added an emmitter follower
    - aka a common collector configuration
    - aka current amplifier
    - to not draw current when quiet
  - added volume control
    - at the output of the stage 1
    - or at the output of the second stage
