    as transistors get smaller, they =power= density stays constant

  - The more specialized you are, the more efficient you are
    [[https://semiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/22341-broderson_efficiency.jpg]]
  - good for doing fixed(?) mathematical operations
  - less power usage for some use cases
  - gains
    - code       10x
    - logic     100x customizing circuits (fpga,dsp)
    - circuit  1000x analog circuits (not boolean gates)
    - devices 10000x ???
  - embrace approximation, where you can afford impresicion

    - has 8 potentiometers, in yellow
    - has 2 multipliers, in black
    - has 2 opamps, that perform sum
    - has 2 opamps, that invert
    - has 4 opamps, that perform integrations
      - each has the option of providing an initial condition (aka constant of integration)
