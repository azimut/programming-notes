- 1972
- by Hans Camenzind
- based on BJT
- DIP8
- Used as a:
  - timer delay
  - pulse generator
  - oscillator

* Insides

- 2 Comparators (2 inputs and 1 output, if input a<b output is on, if not is off)
- 1 Flip-Flip (aka SR Latch)
- 3 5k resitors, that made a =voltage divider=
- 1 Transistor (on to discharge ~pin 7~ and to GND)

* Circuit Configurations
** Astable

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlSFm519Bo

- ~Astable~: there are no stable binary state

- rate of charging and discharging times, will depend on:
  - charging: 1k / 100k / 1uf
  - discharging: 100k
    - we can swap the 100k resistor for a variable resistor (with a serial resistor to provide a floor)

** Monostable

- ~Monostable~: there is 1 binary state that is stable

- We want to switch to a *manual control* of the clock
  - One Tick per Button Push
  - But, we CANNOT /just/ use a button, due it will physically bounce.
  - To *debounce* the button we use another =555=
    - with a very small capacitor
    - And a button on pin 2 (trigger)

- Next problem: How to switch between both?

** Bistable

- We can use a switch to go output either the Astable or Monostable.
  - BUT, we still need some *debounce* on the switch.
  - Even when switches are either, "break before make" or "make before break"

- This time ( differently from above (for fun) )
  We would use just the internal *SR Latch*.
* Tips

- from datasheet, put a 0.01uf =capacitor= from ~pin 5~ (CV) to GND, for no janky OUTPUT
- from datasheet, lock/tying ~pin 4~ (RESET latch) to VCC
- Some other overshoot/spikes of output might be due noise in our cable *impedance*, try:
  - reducing the size of the cable
  - or putting a 0.1uf capacitor between GND and VCC pins (the closest to the chip the better)
    - on circuits, chips usually do have capacitor near for this reason

* Naming

#+begin_src
NE555V
#+end_src

- LMC, TLC, ICM7 = low power CMOS version
- NE = commercial (0° - +70°)
- SE = militar (-55° - +125°)
- Variants
  - 556: DIP14 2x555
  - 558/9: DIP16 ~4x555
- T = metal
- V = epoxy
- N = ?
