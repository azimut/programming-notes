** parallel/flash comparator:

- $++, fast (GHz), ~accurate
- all comparators have a clock is important that it happens at the same time
- the bits determine it's _resolution_

** succesive approximation

 - only 1 comparator
 - uses a DAC to provide the Vref
 - supplied by a ever changing supply signal (ME: seems like it does a kind of "binary search")
 - takes longer
 - SAR = Successive Approximation Register
