* types
** parallel/flash comparator:

- $++, fast (GHz), ~accurate
- all comparators have a clock is important that it happens at the same time
- the bits determine it's _resolution_

** SAR - Succesive approximation register

- uses a *DAC* to provide the Vref
- only 1 *comparator*
- works by comparing
  - the input voltage providing
  - with different voltages in a binary search fashion
- takes longer
- 8 to 18 bits (?
- up to 10MSPS (?
