#+TITLE: OTA = Operational Transductance Amplifiers

- outputs is current, input is voltage
  - _changes in voltage, end up in changes in current_
- has an *amplifier bias input* pin, which takes current
- Transconductance = iOut / vIn
- Ideal:
  - infinite Zin (input impedance)
  - infinite Zout (output impedance)
- usually not operated in closed loop form (don't have wacky gains)
- inputs diff have to be close to zero
- apply current to the end to set the transconductance
- Dbs per Octave
  - 1 OTA/stage  = 5db
  - 2 OTA/stages = 12db
  - 4 OTA/stages = 24db
