- subtractive

    lfo    adsr      adsr

* Envelope

- ADSR/AD/AR/DADSR

- output types
  - linear to control CV
  - exponential to control pitch/loudness

- they shape a gate signal

* Filters

- aka tone modifier (removes some of the harmonics)
- Slope = how strong it filters, in decibel per octave (db/oct)
  - aka "nr of poles"
  - 1 pole = 6db/oct
  - 4 pole = 24db/oct
  - more poles = more steep

- resonance
  - boosts frequencies around cutoff frequency
  - generated frequency peak width is called Q
  - maximum resonance would create a sine wave (ish)

- Filter Types/Modes
  - Notch = blocks freq around cutoff
  - HPF = passes freq above cutoff
  - BPF = passes freq around cutoff
  - LPF = passes freq below cutoff

* Oscillators

- In tonal sounds, the harmonics have a fixed integer relationship to the fundamental
- Sine
  - has 1 harmonic, the fundamental
  - makes it good for frequency/amplitude modulation
  - difficult to produce by analog synths
    - ?you can get one by applying a LFO to a square wave?
- Sawtooth:
  - frequency determined by duration of second phase
- Ramp = Sawtooth mirrored
- Rectangle/Pulse = Square with non 50% duty cycle
- Formant = a group of harmonics that are boosted by resonance
- Digital Wavetable
  - stored in memory are the shapes of many different types of waves
  - can crossfade between them (sequentially or in a predefined order)
