* TODO Course: Syntorial
- This is for subtractive synths (most are)
** Order to figure out a synth
  1) Amp Envelope (Attack/Release)
  2) CutOff/Env ammount
  3) Filter Envelope
  4) OSC Mix 50/50
  5) OSC Semitones
  6) OSC Wave
  7) OSC Mix
  8) Main Volume
** Instruments Examples
  Bass: low cutoff, zero amp attack, square
  Lead: bright(high cutoff), zero amp atack
  Pad: soft attack, long release, low cutoff
  Design Pads:
  - Soft texture
  - Lower cutoff, and raise the amp+release
  - Filter env for "movement"
** Wine

http://www.verona.se/2015/07/17/syntorial-on-fedora/
#+begin_src
In order to get synth sound to work, you need to use Wine 1.4, which
is a pretty old version compared to Wine 1.7 which was the Fedora
version. I used PlayOnLinux to get this old Wine version. The problem
has something to do with how Wine emulates the Windows sound API. You
also need to set Wine emulation to Windows 7 or higher.
#+end_src

**  1 OSC and Pulse Width

- Two basic OSCs forms:
  1) saw
     * bright, edgy
     * thing&buzzy on the lower notes
  2) pulse
     * more "bassy", "videogame", "artificial"
     * heavier on the lower notes

- Pulse Widths (sometimes called simmetry): thin, medium, square
  - on high notes medium (or thin) make both OSCs sound similar
  - has no effect on Saw (?)

**  2 LFO

- LFO, Low Pass Filter, determines brightness
  - =Cutoff=: < rounder and darker, "bass" sound, harder to recoignize wave
              > brighter and edgier
  - Side-effect: affects volume

**  3 Amp Envelope: AR

- to "modulate" means to "change"
- =Attack=: silence to full volume time
  - Long - gooddd for Pads or Ambient in the background
  - Short - attack, string attack kind of a "reverse" attack /effect
- =Release=: a.k.a "fadeout"
  - Long - for pads, ambient
  - Short - tail, reverb
  - Good to default to 15ms

**  4 2nd OSC

- Second OSC
  - makes it "taller", more range
  - Mix Volume, to "glue it" better
  - Semitone wheel pitch of OSC
    - 12 semitones = octave
    -  7 semitones = fifth

**  5 Filter Envelope: AR

- An alternative to *filter envelope* is a *MODulation envelope*

- =Env Ammount= Knob:
  - max brightness, aka distance from cutoff
  - If you move the cutoff it will "move" the env ammount
- =Cutoff=:
  - min brightness
  - controls the darkest it can sound

- =Attack=:
  - from cutoff to env ammount
  - gradually makes the sound brighter
  - small gives a "horn like attack"
- =Release=:
  - from env ammount to cutoff
  - tip: if amp release is short, you won't ear it

**  6 Delay

- Delay Mix:
  - Balance between
    - original sound (~dry~ signal)
    - and echoes (~wet~ signal)
  - At 0%  - 100% dry -  0%wet
  - At 13% -  87% dry - 13%wet
  - You "don't want" to have it higher than %50
  - It lowers the original, and in the end all audio
  - Creates "space" almost like a reverb

- Delay Time:
  - makes it closer or farther apart
  - expressed in rhythm values
    - 1/4 is 1 beat

- Delay Feedback:
  - how many echos are created
    - 1.0 is infinite delays
    - 0.0 is One fast echo (aka "slapback" delay)

- Delay Spread:
  - panning
  - dry on the middle and echos on the sides
  - Makes it big and wide.
  - Used for leads.

- Delay Sync: button to keep them on beat
- Mix, time, feedback, general volume
- Used: rhythm patterns, create a "space" in the sound, almost like a reverb
- Rule: No delay on Bass patches. Low range should be sound clean.

**  7 Amp Envelope: DS

- Amplitude envelope
  - =Decay=: how fast it goes from Attack to Sustain
  - =Sustain=: volume while the key is pressed
- "Attack Transient" a burst, aggresive short Attack

**  8 OSC pitch detunning

- =Fine Tune Wheel=
  - changed by cents
  - ~1 semitone = 100 cents~
  - do NOT change just one, it will sound out of pitch
  - Detuning in different directions on equal ammounts,
    creates a smearing-pulsating effect.
  - If you move only 1 (one) move it 1 cent

- =Oscillator start=
  ON  aggressive attack, consistent pulsation (when detuning)
  OFF softer attack, varying pulsation

**  9 Filter Envelope: DS

- AR - time based
- D  - time based
  - create the attack transient
- S  - ammount based
  - 0%  is the "darkest" sound (cutoff)
  - 100% is the "brightest" sound (env ammount)

** 10 Sub OSC

- Sub Oscillator
  - Is a 3rd oscillator
  - Has a fixed ~pitch~ 1 Octave below 1st OSC
  - Only Controls
    - Volume controls
    - Wave
      - Pulse = Bright
      - Triangle = Round (subtle low end)
        - tip: If pops add small Attack amp
  - Adds bottom end and weight

- Common with 2, both detuned(cents)
- Common with 2, same OSCs, 1 transposed an octave above
- tip: If used on BASS patches, place the BASS 1 Octave higher

** 11 LFO

- Used to create *repeating movement* on controls/knobs
  - using a wave (including random = sample&hold) for PWM
  - using the current value as middle
  - Destination Examples:
    - Vibrato(pitch)
    - Tremolo(volume)
    - Gate(any)
    - AutoFilter(cutoff)
    - Pan
    - Pulse Width Modulation

- LFO knobs
  - =Ammount= : the ammount of effect it has
  - =Rate=    : speed up or down

- Saw/Square is common with Volume/Cutoff (aka *gate effect*)

** 12 Filter Resonance

- Boosts your sound near his "brightess" point.
- Changes the "top" of the sound
- Thight, Focus, adds 'point' to the sound, juicy
- Used in wah pedals with a LFO controlled cutoff
- at MAX makes a ringing sound (aka self-oscilation) only on some synts.

- LFO: Can be used directly or indirectly (with the cutoff)

- tip: interesting? effect
  - lfo: sample&hold on cutoff
  - full filter resonance

** 13 Voice Modes

- How many voices/notes can be played at once.
- With 1, synth would steal the voice of the earliest to keep his Voice count.

- =Mono=
  - Forces single-note playing
  - avoids slides, overlaps
  - useful for basses and leads
  - bad for long releases (pads)
- =Poly=
  - if you use a long release and you want to ear it.
  - Common on Pads or Leads (avoid on bass)

** 14 Unison

- Takes the idea of "doubling" and "detuning" and magnifies it.
- A way to get a "big" sound
- Aggressive

- Unison Controls
  - =Voice Count=: adds more voices and detunes them
  - =Detune=: the distance between each unison voice
  - =Spread/Pan=: takes all the unison voices and pan them
    - 0.0, in he middle
    - 0.5, middle, left and right
    - MAX, left and right, they don't overlap (loses pulsation)

- tip: OSC Start button, plays a role here too

** 15 Reverb

- Dry = Original sound
- Wet = Reverb / Room sound

- =Reverb Mix=
  - balance between Dry/Wet
  - the more Wet, the farther "away" you are from the sound
- =Reverb Size/Length/Time=
  - determines the "room size"

- tip: Can be combined with delay (aka the discrete echoes).
- tip: Careful with Bass patches

** 16 Voice Modes: Legato, Portamento

- =Legato= Voice Mode
  - Affects amplitude
  - The Envelope carries through 2 notes touches sequentially.
  - "Smoothing Connecting Play"
  - Holds the Sustain, before falling on the decay

- =Portamento= Voice Mode
  - bends each not ~Pitch~ to the next note ~Pitch~
  - knob measured in time
  - in legato mode (with portament auto mode)
    - only applies to connected notes
    - smoother

** 17 OSC mixing

- Triange + Saw   (Mix 70/30)
- Triange + Pulse (Mix 70/30)
- Bump amp attack if needed

** 18 Chorus

- Pulsates, smears and widens/pans sound
- Softer, more subtle than Unison
- =Chorus Rate=: multiplier of speed
- =Chorus Mix=: % between Dry and Mix
- eg: on pads, don't over do it on basses

** 19 Mod Envelope: Pitch

- Modulation Envelope
  - you can pick the =destination= (eg: pitch of either OSC)
  - can have only =AD= controls
    - A = D = 0, nothing happens
    - A starts at pitch, to above it
    - D starts above pitch, down to it
  - =Ammount= knob, how high is modulated too

** 20 OSC Sync

- =OSC1= acts as master, *mutates* ~OSC2~ slave
- You don't need to hear =OSC1=
- Change ~OSC2~ semitone knobe to hear the effect
  - Avoid octaves(12) and fifths(7), they won't give you grinding
  - +9 semitones
  - works well with Mod Envelope or LFO

** 21 HPF/BPF

- LPF = cuts the highs above cutoff, roundness
- HPF = cuts the lows below cutoff, thin
- BPF = cuts high and lows around cutoff, thin+round

- Filter Slope: how sharp cuts sound
  - in synthorial 24dB on LPF and 12dB with HPF/BPF

** 22 FM - Frequency Modulation

- There is a knob =ammount= control
  - making your sound metallic

- OSC2(modulator) mutates OSC1(carrier)
  - muted OSC2
  - detuned OSC2
  - can be the same wave
  - can be target of =Mod Envelope=
    - eg: transient of bass

** 23 Noise

- noise volume knob, white noise, no pitch
- commonly used with a resonant filter envelope

- Sound is Air Particles
- A speaker, moves those particles to be more compressed or less
- Properties of sound: Pitch, Volume, Timbre
- Timbre: has different ammount of frequencies
- Connecting the output sine wave to the "CV input"
  - Generates a "saw wave"
  - Which ALSO adds more frequencies to the sound
    - *Harmonics*, or more generally *Partials*
    - While the SINE wave had only 1 frequency
- Waves
  - Square
    - Has odd Harmonics, louder on odd ones
  - Triangle
    - Has very vew harmonics
- Filter
  - Cutoff: Can be used to remove Harmonics or Isolate them
  - Resonance Control: makes the filter resonate following the input signal
    You control more or less, the frequency that will resonate to,
    so you can walk through the harmonics and the fundamental
- Harmonics=Overtones
- The resonance sweep of a filter, can be though as an arpeggio,
  due the distance between the frequencies.
- Additive synthesis: you add Harmonics
- Substractive syntesis: you remove Harmonics from a complex audio

   - it took 50+ years after Fourier
   - to realize that
     - sound is a sum of waveforms
     - sound is energy

   - tldr: synth modules are analog computers that compute a specific algorithm
   - *functions* that you want on you synth module to do with soundwaves:
     1) generating
     2) processing
     3) mixing
   - what you want is a well balanced set of *functions*
   - that will give you an instrument
   - for every *function* there is an **algorithm**
     - aka "a way to do something"
     - they will process soundwaves
     - they do a =computation=, digitally or analogically

   - analog computing
     - you can process continuosly
     - parallel processing, even feeding back without delay
   - digital computing
     - chopping in bytes to process
     - serial processing, timing issues for parallel
5) https://vimeo.com/233847449
   - sound properties: based on the physical model "resonator model"
     1) pitch (the osc, the energy source)
     2) amplitude/loudness
     3) timbre
   - =modulation= is the change of sound properties over time
6) https://vimeo.com/234514050
   - recursion can be used in algorithms with feedback
   - in DSPs you don't have recursion (?
   - brigthness knob
   - 5Khz = air, sounds in acoustics and voice
     - you don't want to mask it with synths
   - his VCO
     - has only 2 osc, sine and cosine
     - derives others
     - has a "add harmonics" knob, from sine to saw
