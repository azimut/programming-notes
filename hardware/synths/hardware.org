    - A LPF/HPF can be done with just a _capacitor_ and a _resistor_
      - _capacitor_ being a difficult path for low frequencies
      - it has a fixed cutoff
      - or controlled by a _potentiometer_ instead of a _resistor_
    - However a voltage/current controlled one would be preffered

      - do not use electricity
      - not have a bus connection
      - 1 input many outputs
      - drop a bit of voltage
    - buffered
      - use electricity from the bus board
      - no voltage drop

- propabilistic sequencers
- boolean logic
- trigger skipping
- burst generator
- slewing

      - *delay* to fade-in lfo effect
  - =Tremolo= (Volume)
    - you have hook it through 1 intermediate vca (2 in total)
