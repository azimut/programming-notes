- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV/gate
- Types of =Control= voltage signals (-12v,12v)
  - Gate     (0v or 10v, 0v or 5v)
  - Trigger  (0v or 10v) a sort of "instant gate"
  - Pitch CV
    - 1v = C
    - between 0v and 5v, 1v per octave
      - same Voltage as clocks?
    - or? between -+5V
  - Oscillators, LFO, ADSR, Offset, invertor (-12v,12v)
