* Pedals

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otkW_q0_VIU
- Cheap:
  - M-vave Chocolate
  - M-Vave Tank-G
  - M-Vave Cube-Baby
- 82Hz lowest note on guitar
- distortion based pedal, from less to high
  - distortion > overdrive > fuzz
- others
  - noise gate
  - chorus
  - phaser
  - tremolo
  - delay: analog, tape delay, ping pong, jewel
  - reverb: hall room spring

* Form Factors

- Dimensions
  - 1" = 1 inch
  - 2.5" to 3" hex screws to mounts in eurorack
    - add a washer to prevent scratches
  - Width in HP, from the minimal space between screws in *threaded strip*
    - 1 HP = 0.2"
  - U = Height in rack U(nits), from the minimal spacing in an 1.75inch rack
  - Depth 10cm

* Types

- Offset Generators: add or subtract
- Effects
  - Phase
  - Delay http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/delay-technology/4113
- Utilities
  - Mixers
  - Multiples: creates copies of a signal
    - passive
      - do not use electricity
      - not have a bus connection
      - 1 input many outputs
      - drop a bit of voltage
    - buffered
      - use electricity from the bus board
      - no voltage drop

- propabilistic sequencers
- boolean logic
- trigger skipping
- burst generator
- slewing
- step random
- smooth random
- LPG = Low Pass Gate
- Waveshaper/Wavefolders

** Clocks

- Can be
  - Gates
  - Triggers

- clock division
- clock multiplication
- Gate Delay

- Form Factors
  - Midi-to-CV module, can convert MIDI's clock
  - Clock generator module
  - Square LFO/VCO
    - can have a "manual" trigger button
  - "Expert sleepers" DAW -> EuroRack (?
  - Clock divider/multiplier module

** Sample&Hold

- Inputs
  1) changing signal
  2) trigger signal
- Outputs: holds value read at 1, until the next clock

** CV&Gate Sequencer

- INPUT: clock
- OUTPUT: voltage pitch of that step of the sequence

- will cycle through outputs through clocks
- has a *sequencer reset* signal
- some have pitch/voltage quantizers
- type:
  - triggered sequencer: for drums
  - cv sequencer: for melodies

** CVP = Control Voltage Processor

- Generators?
- Airtenuators, between cables attenuator
- Amplifiers & Attenuators: offset/increase or reduce a signal
- Polarizers/Attenuverters: offset/reduce and invert a signal
- Inverters
- Glide: aka slow+smooth?
- has a 2 color led to indicate positive and negative voltage output

** LFO = Low Frequency Oscillator

- input voltage controls the frequency
- switch for frequency range (low,med,high)
- create slow periodic wave forms
- waveshapes: square, triangle, saw, reverse saw, sine
- Uses: wawa, pwm
- Examples:
  - =Vibrato= (pitch)
    - you might want to enable
      - *sync* to play notes in sync
      - *delay* to fade-in lfo effect
  - =Tremolo= (Volume)
    - you have hook it through 1 intermediate vca (2 in total)
    - you have to offset the lfo
  - =Gate= (any)
  - AutoFilter(cutoff)

**  EG = Envelope Generator

- adsr/ad/ar

** VCO = Voltage Controlled Oscillator

- aka tone generator
- 20Hz-20kHz (audible)
- CV
  - frequency
    - exponential CV (1V per octave)
    - linear CV
  - pulse width
  - sync
- Manual
  - knobs: coarse freq, fine freq, pulse width
  - switch: octaves

- Noise types
  [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/The_Colors_of_Noise.svg/576px-The_Colors_of_Noise.svg.png]]

- Can be *Sync* with another VCO, reset after sync finish a cycle.
  1) Hard: core ramp is *reset* to zero
  2) Soft: triangle ramp direction is *reversed*

- Core wave types, from which other waves can be generated, either:
  1) Ramp
  2) Triangle

** VCF = Voltage Controlled Filter

- Inputs
  - (key) exponential CV (1v per octave)
  - (key) linear CV
  - (Audio) Signal IN
- Outputs: LPF/HPF/BPF
- CV controls
  - resonance
  - COF = cutoff frequency
    - fine
    - coarse

** VCA = Voltage Controlled Amplifier

- input voltage controls the amplitude
- aka loudness shaper
- has a red led to indicate overdrive (distortion added)

** MIDI to CV&Gate converter

- Creates a *gate* signal when we press a midi key.
- Creates a pitch cv

** IO Modules

- audio common formats
  - typical module
    - 10v+ peak to peak
    - +11/+20dBv
    - unbalanced
  - -10dBv reference "line level"
    - consumer grade stereo
    - 0.895v peak to peak
    - unbalanced: 2 wires
