  - 1
    - A LPF/HPF can be done with just a _capacitor_ and a _resistor_
      - _capacitor_ being a difficult path for low frequencies
      - it has a fixed cutoff
      - or controlled by a _potentiometer_ instead of a _resistor_
    - However a voltage/current controlled one would be preffered (aka an OTA)

1) #1197
   - Output phase (opamp + potentiometer)
   - White Noise generator (zener diode)
2) #1198 - OSC Square & Triangle
   - a resistor between each opamp (at the integrator input) it will change the frequency/pitch
   - 2 opamp
     - 1 working as an integrator (triangle)
     - 1 working as a comparator with GND (square)
3) #1199 - Mixer

** VCO

- Creating a Sawtooth OSC from:
  - Schmitt trigger (4016)
  - Diode(signal), capacitor(2.2nF), resistor(100k)

- To "listen" to it we would need to build a OpAmp buffer

** Drum
- Old schools drum machines were complex machines consisting of:
  - VCO + VCF + VCA + ENV + FILTER
  - eg: Roland 606

- Basic _Functional_ Blocks:
  - OSC: continuous
  - Volume Modulator: decay of volume, controlled by a input "gate" signal
  - Frequency Modulator: pitch/volume control of OSC

- Bridge-T Oscillator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_bridge_oscillator
  - opamp + 2 resistor + 2 capacitors
  - a sinewave oscillator
  - need to be kickstarted by a pulse
    - triggered when voltage changes
  - Roland 606 parts: 1M + 51k + 15nF = 15Hz

- Gate-to-Trigger Converter: to avoid retrigger of kickstart on single pulses
