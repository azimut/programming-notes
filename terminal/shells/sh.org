- OPINION: one way that shell scripts hide/handle complexity is by transforming data through pipes. What in other programming languages might need nested function calls or temporary variables. Pipes are, in a way, similar to method chaining.

  #+begin_src sh
    until ssh root@10.10.10.10; do sleep 3; done
  #+end_src
