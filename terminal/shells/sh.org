- OPINION: one way that shell scripts hide/handle complexity is by transforming data through pipes. What in other programming languages might need nested function calls or temporary variables. Pipes are, in a way, similar to method chaining.
- use one /=/ when comparing strings, [[https://eklitzke.org/bash-if-equals][/==/ is NOT supported]]
  #+begin_src sh
    if [ "$foo" = "$bar" ]
  #+end_src

* snippets

  #+begin_src sh
