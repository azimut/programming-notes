* History

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron][Artificial neuron]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism][Connectionism]]: NN research for the study of the human mental processes, were given the name of.
  - aka connectionist networks
  - aka artificial neural networks

** 43: McCulloch & Pitts

- Warren McCulloch, Pitts
- [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf][paper]]
- video Neural Networks 4: McCulloch & Pitts neuron https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osa3zIEJjgw
- introduced the =perceptron=
- argued that a network of neurons can also perform logic ops

- in a real ones there is:
  - an exchange of chemicals
  - a transmition delay to sync firing
  - modulate their firing frequency

- Parts:
  - Dendrites
    - roles: excitory, inhibitory
    - multiple INPUTS
    - each weighted (aka with a strength)
  - Body (or Cyton):
    - sums inputs
  - Axon
    - single OUTPUT fired/activated (binary)
      - if a _threshold_ is met (squashing/sigmoid fn)
      - proportional to input
    - branches into dendrites

** 49: Hebb

- Donald Hebb
- neural psychological theory on how the NN worked
- neurons =connections strength=
  - grew if they were fired repeatedly at the same time
  - +stronger => +weight
  - "Cells that fire together wire together."

** 58: Rosenblatt

- Frank Rosenblatt
- "The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage And Organization In The Brain."

** 55: McCarthy & Minsky & Shannon

- John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon
- workshop on artificial intelligence in Darthmouth
- "An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves."

** 69: Minsky & Papert

- Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert
- Limitations of Perceptron
- End of 1st wave

** 87: McClelland & Rumelhart

- James L. McClelland, David E. Rumelhart
- book about Parallel Distributed Processing
- introduced ~hidden layers~
