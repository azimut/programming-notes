** backpropagation neural networks
- trained by  applying training inputs to the networks
- compare differences/errors between
  1) propagated values
  2) training data values
- we magnitude of these errors are used to adjust the weights in the network
- some problems while trying to find "good enough" weights
  1) (randomness) sometimes he accumulated error at a *local minimum* is too large, is best to restart the training
  2) (memory) if we have enough *memory* and with not enough data, we might just memorize the training data.
     memory=weights. start using a small network.
- the ~activation values~ of individual neurons are limited to the range [0,1].
  - sum of the activation values of neurons in the previous layer *times* the values of the connecting weights and then
    using *sigmoid* function to map the sums to desired range.

** introduction
- know, stats (to know how to describe the "patterns" in the data)
- know, ~bayes~ (to know the likelihood an algorithm is correct)
- know, it (information theory) to measure kinds of information
- do, machine learning classification to explore the data we have before dl
- know, ensambles of different ml systems instead of a big one, sometimes is better
- ~backpropagation~ (a way of training) and ~optizers~ (modifies the network numbers)
- ~convnet~ (convolution neural networks) made to handle spatial data, like images. like recognizing objects.
- ~autoencoders~ simplify datasets, or clean images (?
- ~recurrent neural networks~ for sequences (text or audio)
- ~attention and transformers~ to interpret and generate text
- ~reinforment learning~ ?
- ~generative adversarial networks~ to generate data
** part 1
** 1 an overview of machine learning
- our goal (with ml) is to discover *meaningful* information,
  where is up to us decide what's *meaninful*.
- ~expert systems~: we create rules from what the experts tells us. feature engineering.
- ~supervised learning~: we provide *labeled* data.
  when the system gets enough right answers for our needs we can say it is *trained*
- ~unsupervised learning~: it learns about the relationships between the inputs provided.
  used for clustering into groups.
  used to improve the quality of data.
  used for compress data.
- ~reinforment learning~ when we search to optimize (? something, but we don't know how.
  while we judge how good or bad the algorthim is in relative terms. ("probably good", "better than the last one")
  it can be always searching with new data, while using the "best" solution found.
- ~deep learning~ uses a series of steps or *layers* for computation
- neurons turn input value into a number.
  neurons stay the same, what can change is the input and weights
  initial weights are random.
  loop -> weights are adjusted carefully by a small ammount. and output is judged.
  neurons converge into looking for *features* although we never told him to.

** Hands On:
1) ?
2) change lr
   - try very small and large values, what happens?
   - what we gain and lose?
3) increase lr from 0.001,
   - notice how at some point loss starts increasing
4) use data/life-expectancy
5) print weights, besides bias, what does they tell us?
   which column has the biggest impact?
6) What digits would be harder to regonize than 5? Guess and then try.
7) Minesweper
   - use Sonar dataset (aka "mines vs rocks")
   - change hyperparameters
   - binary classification
   - set aside 48 of 208 examples for testing
     - shuffle first
   - try to reach 75% accuracy

*** 3 walking the gradient

**** Our Algorithm doesn't cut it

- Problems with our current =train()=
  1) doesn't scale well (cpu/time) when adding new _hyperparameters_ (INPUTS)
  2) is NOT precise, since _hyperparameters_ are defined in *lr* (learning rate) terms

- observation:
  - a plot of loss(), when b=0, looks like a U curve

- Solution: 𝛿l/𝛿w - =Gradient Descent=
  - to measure the gradient
  -"the derivative of the loss with respect to the weight"
  - derivative on point is <0, if loss decr when w does it
  - derivative on point is >0, if loss incr when w does it
  - derivative on point is  0, if is a minimum

**** A Sprinkle Of Math

#+CAPTION: Loss = Mean Squared Error of our model
$$L = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (({wx_i}+{b}) - {y_i})^2$$

Where $${m}$$ is the number of examples.

#+CAPTION: partial derivative of L, with respect to w, pretending b is constant
$$\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{w}} = \frac{2}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} {x_i} (({wx_i}+{b}) - {y_i})$$

**** Downhill Riding

#+begin_src python
  def gradient(X,Y,w):
      return 2 * np.average(X * (predict(X,w,0) - Y))

  def train(X,Y,iterations,lr):
      w = 0
      for i in range(iterations):   # no ifs
          print("Iteration: %4d => Loss: %.10f" %
                (i, loss(X,Y,w,0)))
          w -= gradient(X,Y,w) * lr # opposite direction of gradient()
      return w                      # no early return
#+end_src

- found good hyperparameters (by trial&error)
  - iterations=100
  - lr=0.001
  - w=1.8436928702

**** Escape from Flatland

- if we consider $${b}\neq0$$
- loss() becomes a 3D surface
- =Partial Derivatives=
  - a way to calculate *Gradient Descend* for multiple INPUT variables
  - by first calculating the gradient of a lower dimension "slice"
  - then combining the slices to get the gradient of the surface

#+CAPTION: derivative, now pretending w is constant
$$\frac{\partial{L}}{\partial{b}} = \\
  \frac{2}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (({wx_i}+{b}) - {y_i})$$

**** Putting =Gradient Descent= To The Test

#+begin_src python
  def gradient(X,Y,w,b):
      w_gradient = 2 * np.average(X * (predict(X,w,b) - Y))
      b_gradient = 2 * np.average(    (predict(X,w,b) - Y))
      return (w_gradient, b_gradient)

  def train(X,Y,iterations, lr):
      for i in range(iterations):
          print("Iteration: %4d => Loss: %.10f" %
                (i, loss(X,Y,w,b)))
          w_gradient, b_gradient = gradient(X,Y,w,b)
          w -= w_gradient * lr
          b -= b_gradient * lr
      return w, b

  w, b = train(X,Y,iterations=20_000,lr=0.001) # less iterations
  print("|nw=%.10f, b=%.10f" % (w,b))          # more precise
  print("Prediction: x=%d => y=%.2f" %
        (20, predict(20,w,b)))
#+end_src

**** When =Gradient Descent= Fails

- Problems:
  - There is no guarantee that is the shortest path
  - It might miss the target completely
  - Can get confused with sudden loss() surface cliffs
  - Can get stuck on a local minimum

- loss() surface should be:
  - convex: no bumps
  - continuous: no cliffs or gaps
  - differentiable: smooth, without cusps

- ergo:
  - mean absolute < mean squared

*** 4 Hyperspace!

- =Multiple Linear Regression=
  $${y} = {x_1}{w_1} + {x_2}{w_2} + {...} + {b}$$
  - for more than 1 input
  - aka weighted sum of the inputs

**** Matrix Math

- Matrix sizes: big, uneven
- Matrix operations:
  - multiplication
    - order matters
    - if m1.cols = m2.rows
    - if inner dimensions are equal
    - (4,3) * (3,2) = (4,2)
  - transpose
    - flip it around diagonal \
    - rows become columns
    - columns become rows
    - T(4,3) = (3,4)

**** Code

- we make the input a single big matrix
- TIP: avoid mixing numpy matrixes and 1D arrays

#+begin_src python
  import numpy as np

  x1,x2,x3,y = np.loadtxt("pizza_3_vars.txt", skiprows=1, unpack=True)
  bias = np.ones(x1.size)
  X = np.column_stack((bias,x1,x2,x3))
  Y = y.reshape(-1,1)
  w = train(X,Y,iterations=100_000,lr=0.001)

  print("\nWeights: %s" % w.T) # bias w0 w1 w2
  print("\nA few predictions:")
  for i in range(5):
      print("X[%d] -> %.4f (label: %d)" %
            (i, predict(X[i],w), Y[i]))

  # predict() now becomes a matrix multiplication
  # X - a matrix (m,n)
  #   , m = # of examples
  #   , n = # of input vars
  def predict(X,w):
      return np.matmul(X,w)

  def loss(X,Y,w):     # Y - Ground Truth, (m,1)
      return np.average((predict(X,w)-Y)**2)

  def gradient(X,Y,w): # no change
      return 2 * np.matmul(X.T, (predict(X,w)-Y)) / X.shape[0]

  def train():
      w = np.zeros((X.shape[1], 1))
      for i in range(iterations):
          print("Iteration %4d => Loss: %.20f" %
                (i, loss(X,Y,w)))
          w -= gradient(X,Y,w) * lr
      return w
#+end_src

*** 5 A Discerning Machine

- =Classifier=
  - a program that assigns data
  - to one of a limited number of classes
  - instead of _numerical labels_
  - works with _categorical labels_
  - =Binary Classifier=
    - only recognizes 2 classes

**** Where Linear Regression fails

Scenario: we want to predict if we get a police noise complain (a boolean).

With Linear Regression
- We assume that the data points are roughly alined to begin with.
- If they arranged in a curve or scattered randomly, we cannot approximate them with a line.
- Prediction is unstable in the case of outliers

**** Invasion of the =Sigmoids=

- =Logistic Regression=
  - To adapt our Linear Regresion for Binary Classification

- =Logistic Function=
  $$\sigma({z}) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$
  - Belongs to the =Sigmoid= family of fn's
  - fn that restrict predictions in [0,1] range
  - works well with =Gradient Descent=
    1) smooth
    2) without flat areas (=0)
    3) without gaps (without undefined values)

*** 6 Getting Real

- Input: MNIST

- We flatten the input character images into a single row of features
  - we loss the geometry data
  - such technique would not work for other type of recognition (eg: discern between races of elephants)

**** Load Images

#+begin_src python

  X_test  = prepend_bias(load_images("../data/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz"))
#+end_src

**** Load Labels

- We transform the labels to 0 for "not-5" and 1 for "5"

#+begin_src python
  def load_labels(filename): # return a 1 column matrix
      with gzip.open(filename, 'rb') as f:

*** 7 the final challenge
**** new encoding of labels

Label Encoding Problem: multiclass clasification

Solution 1: run many "Weighted Sum Sigmoid" fns and return the one with highest chance.
Solution 2: we create a matrix of bitsets for the results (=One-Hot Encoding=). We have as many digits as classes.

We use this to initialize the training data.

#+begin_src python
  def one_hot_encode(Y):
      n_labels = Y.shape[0]
      n_classes = 10
      encoded_Y = np.zeroes((n_labels,n_classes))
      for i in range(n_labels):
          label = Y[i]
          encoded_Y[i][label] = 1
      return encoded_Y
#+end_src

**** new classify()

now needs to do more work now than just rounding forward()

#+begin_src python
  def classify(X,w):
      y_hat = forward(X,w)
      labels = np.argmax(y_hat, axis=1) # get index of max
      return labels.reshape(-1,1)
#+end_src

**** new weights

#+begin_src python
  # 785x10
  w = np.zeroes((X_train.shape[1], Y_train.shape[1]))
#+end_src

**** new loss()

instead of np.average over all the matrix
we average over all lines

#+begin_src python
  def loss(X,Y,w):
      y_hat = forward(X,w)
      first_term = Y * np.log(y_hat)
      second_term = (1 - Y) * np.log(1 - y_hat)
      return -np.sum(first_term + second_term) / X.shape[0]

*** 8 Perceptrons

- MNIST is not linearly separable
  - still we get 90% accuracy with it

- 1950
  - Connectivists VS Symbolysts
  - Symbolists:
    - Programming a AI from the ground up (LISP)
    - Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert
  - Connectivists:
    - Build a brain and intelligence will come.
    - Frank Rosenblatt
    - Final Processing step = Activation Function

- Multilayer perceptron can, in theory, work with non-linear separable data.
- Are multilayer perceptron impossible to train?
** Part II: Neural Networks

More powerful than Perceptrons, but with their own challenges.
We will aim to 99% accuracy with MNIST.

**** Enter =Softmax=

We replace the last *Activation Function* with it.
Returns a value between 0 and 1.
Sum of it's outputs is always 1. (aka normalizes the sum to 1)

$$softmax(l_i) = \frac{e^{l_i}}{\sum{e^l}}$$
