SP-NETWORK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjzI5dX8jc
- substitution permutation network
- basis of much of symetric crypto
- for caesar/enigma substitution 1 output character depended only of 1 input character and the algorithm used by them
  - aka blocksize=1
  - enigma changes the substitution key, but it still keeps the blocksize=1
- substitution (inputs mapping)
- permutation (inputs/output mappings)
- key-mixing (split and xor each block in between rounds)
- goes through many rounds (usually rounds have the same logic)

AES https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xNJsjtN6E
- 128-bit simetric block cipher
- aka 16bytes in a 4x4 grid (column major order)
- sp-network (substitution/confusion/permutation/difussion)

Lessons Learned
- It gave me an "emotional connection" to cryptography. Which is making easier learn about in different sources.
