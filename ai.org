* Practical Deep Learning for Coders (2020) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtRL3FMB3GoWHRI8ieU6FhfM
** Lesson 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QUEXsHfsA0
- Neural networks have limited range of things it can do with 1 layer (by Minsky research)
- But with more layers the problem is solved (also by minsky)
- People used just 2 layers which limited performance
- Usinge more layers makes it "DEEP" learning

* 2011 - Machine Learning for the Web - Hilary Mason
** 1 Introduction
- Classification problems:
  - Clustering of categorical data
  - Named Entity Disambiguation: separate different entities (similar)
- Recommendation systems
- Special data (uses domain knowledge)
  - Geographic
  - Timeseries
- Approaches from:
  - Having data
  - Having a problem
  - Have infrastructure
- Methodology:
  1) Obtain
  2) Scrub
  3) Explore
  4) Model
  5) Interpret
** 2 Classifying Web Documents - The Theory
- Problems harder to classify (write logic)
- Supervised learning
  - Examples:
    - SPAM classification
    - language identification
    - Face detection
- Book: "Data Source Handbook"
- NYT has <meta> tags with information about the article.
