** Lesson 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QUEXsHfsA0
- Neural networks have limited range of things it can do with 1 layer (by Minsky research)
- But with more layers the problem is solved (also by minsky)
- People used just 2 layers which limited performance
- Usinge more layers makes it "DEEP" learning

* Video: 2011 - Machine Learning for the Web - Hilary Mason

* Book: 2019 | Neural Networks for Electronics Hobbyists | Richard McKeon
** Preface
- "Illustrates how ~back propagation~ can be
     used to adjust connection strengths or ~weights~ and train a network."
- "We do this manually adjusting potentiometers in the ~hidden layer~"
- Train a model VS Writing a Program
- Going back to figure out *how* a neural network resolved a problem is called ~feature extraction~ delving deep into the ~hidden layers~
** Chapter 1 - Biological Neural Networks
- 44billion neurons in the human brain, and each is connected to thousands
- Neurons Parts:
  * Dendrites: branches, *receive* impulses from other neurons
  * Cell Body: core, *adds* the signals and determines what to do next,
               enough stimulation sends a pulse to the axon
  * Axon: tail, *connects* to other neurons
- Spoilers: Weights, activation potentials, transfer functions
- ~Synapse~: The gap between neurons
  ~Neurotransmitters~: chemical messangers send by neurons
- Sometimes learning just happens
- ~Biomimicry~ inspire solutions from nature
- Software: Steps in training
  1) Produce the result based on the inputs
  2) Check the result against the correct answer we provided.
  3) Adjust connection strenghts between neurons to improve results
  4) Repeat, until errors get really small for all possible inputs
- Hardware: Input Layer, Hidden Layer, Output Layer
** Chapter 2 - Implementing Neural Networks
- We train the NN and we build it in ways for it to
  make adjustments and "learn" to solve the problem
- Artificial Neurons
  1) Inputs
  2) Weight Adjustments
  3) Summation
  4) Transfer Function
  5) Output (for our purposed, it will be a simple yes/no)
- Type of NN used in the book:
  "feed forward" using "back propagation" as the training algorithm
- Feed Forward: signals are sent only in the forward direction
- "Backpropagation of errors": if someone is contributing to a wrong answer, he needs to have is input reduced
- Project will be the "XOR problem", and we will use a 3 layer NN
  - 2 inputs
  - 2 Neurons in the hidden layer
  - 1 output
- Input Layer: like our senses
- Hidden Layer: No connection to the outside world.
- Output Layer: Can be ON or OFF. Or return several outputs.
- Photo of the finish project (what can I see)
  - 7x potentiometer with tips switches
  - 3x 555 IC?, 2 before and 1 after the output layer
  - 2x Transistors near the power source
  - 2x 9v batteries
  - Leds for input/output layers
** Chapter 3 - Electronic Components
- Inclusive OR vs exclusive (X)OR
  - In real life we can use XOR too, ex: we either go to the mountains or the beach
- XOR is ~nonlinear~, meaning an input can result in different values, depending of what the other inputs are doing
- -5V The logic value 0 (false)
  +5V The logic value 1 (true)
- Components
  * Breadboard/Protoboard
  * 22 AWG Solid (not stranded) wire
  * 2x 9v batteries
    - Bipolar Power Supply: +5V, -5V, and ground
    - To have both ~excitatory~ and ~inhibitory~ neurons
  * Voltage regulators, to have a solid/stable voltage
    * 1x +5V regulator (7805)
    * 1x -5V regulator (7905)
  * SPDT - Single Pole Double Throw
    3 Pines, two pins connected at the time.
    Of the sliding type.
    We would pick between +5V and -5V
  * ?x 470ohm resistors (for the led)
  * Led: Anode (+) and Cathode(- aka shorter leg)
  * 10-turn potentiometers: 100K
  * CA3130 op amps, simulate the neurons
    - Tie + and - rails
    - ~activation threshold~ PIN to two-resistor voltage divider
    - ~input~ the output of the summing circuit
- ~Voltage divider~, when a voltage is dropped due resistors between terminals of a power supply
  - 1 resistor can't be measure
  - 2 resistor IF equal half the voltage
  - 1 potentiometer
- We use a ~passive averager~, a type of voltage divider
  If the resistors are the same value:
  - Vout = (V1+V2)/2
  - Vout = (V1+V2+V3)/3
  - See neuron's ~threshold value~ and ~transfer function~
- Op amps usage, as a comparator:
  - If 3>2, output will be HIGH
  - if 3<2, output will be LOW
- There is a *Neuron Y* called ~inhibitory~ neuron
** Chapter 4 - Building the Network
- Cables Color
  * Red   +5V
  * Black GND
  * Blue  -5V
  * Yellow for signals
- Input Layer
  - 2x switches
  - 2x 470ohm
  - 2x led
- Hidden Layer
  - 2x Op amps
    - Threshold: Constant Voltage divider between 100K and 22K, from +V and GND
    - Input: Variable Passive Averager from both inputs layer neurons
- Output Layer
  - Same as a Neuron in Hidden
  - a LED to the output

** Backpropagation Neural Networks
- Trained by  applying training inputs to the networks
- Compare differences/errors between
  1) Propagated values
  2) Training data values
- We magnitude of these errors are used to adjust the weights in the network
- Some problems while trying to find "good enough" weights
  1) (Randomness) Sometimes he accumulated error at a *local minimum* is too large, is best to restart the training
  2) (Memory) If we have enough *memory* and with not enough data, we might just memorize the training data.
     Memory=weights. Start using a small network.
- The ~activation values~ of individual neurons are limited to the range [0,1].
  - Sum of the activation values of neurons in the previous layer *times* the values of the connecting weights and then
    Using *sigmoid* function to map the sums to desired range.

- ~Reinforment Learning~ ?
- ~Generative Adversarial Networks~ to generate data
** Part 1
** 1 An Overview of Machine Learning
- Our goal (with ML) is to discover *meaningful* information,
  where is up to us decide what's *meaninful*.
- ~Expert Systems~: we create rules from what the experts tells us. Feature engineering.
- ~Supervised Learning~: we provide *labeled* data.
  When the system gets enough right answers for our needs we can say it is *trained*
- ~Unsupervised Learning~: it learns about the relationships between the inputs provided.
  Used for clustering into groups.
  Used to improve the quality of data.
  Used for compress data.
- ~Reinforment Learning~ when we search to optimize (? something, but we don't know how.
  While we judge how good or bad the algorthim is in relative terms. ("probably good", "better than the last one")
  It can be always searching with new data, while using the "best" solution found.
- ~Deep Learning~ uses a series of steps or *layers* for computation
- Neurons turn input value into a number.
  Neurons stay the same, what can change is the input and weights
  Initial weights are random.
  Loop -> Weights are adjusted carefully by a small ammount. And output is judged.
  Neurons converge into looking for *features* although we never told him to.
