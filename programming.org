- [[https://wiki.c2.com/?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl]["Don't use exceptions for control flow"]]
  - Exceptions are like non-local goto statements.
  - As such they can be used to build general control flow constructs.
  - As a "rule" it should be fine if you have only 1 thing on the "try"

- 1 based arrays [[https://youtu.be/H3inzGGFefg?t=2775][DConf '22: Lua and Pallene -- Roberto Ierusalimschy]]
  - for languages designed for non-professional programmers
  - most zer0 based languages, are due C
  - but in C you have pointer arithmetic ([] being syntax sugar)

* Lisp Cast
** A Theory of functional programming 0001
   - Started the podcast as a way to put the ideas of his book out of his head
** Is Haskell a Procedural Language
   - Anecdote of working on a system that didn't implement function programming.
     And was growing "too large".
     Most of the code was IO.
   - They weren't doing:
     1) high order abstractions
     2) Data abstractions, operating on that data
     3) Representing things as a pure domain model
   - They needed to abstract and work with that pure representation and then do a min of IO stuff.
   - FP is a mindset, distinguishing between
     - actions (side effects)
     - calculations
     - data

- Propositions as Types - Computerphile
  Prop = Type
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SknxggwRPzU
- Curry-Howard correspondene, aka proofs-as-programs
  - Show where is a close relationship between *logic* and *type theory*
- A function can also be interpreted as "typeA *implies* typeB"
  Given *evicence* of the proposition typeA
  The function(implication) can produce evidence of the proposition typeB
- =State Space= of a running program is the combination of all possible
  values of all its live variables.
- Benefits of Typing are
  1) Correctness
  2) Inmmutability, const, values can be inlined by the compiler
  3) Encapsulation, private methods or fields, api
  4) Composability, generic functions
  5) Readability
- Being able to interpret code as data and data as code
  can lead to catastrophic results
- =Duck Typing= comes from the phrase
  "If it waddles like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it must be a duck"
- Type Systems differn in *when* types are checkd and *how strict* the checks are
  - WHEN Static vs Dynamic
  - HOW  Strong vs Weak
PAGE 15/35
* Book: Head-First Design Patterns
** Design Principles
1) Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2) Program to an interface, not an implementation
** TODO 1 Intro to Design Patterns
- All paterns provide a way to let "some part of a system vary independently of all other parts"
- Inheritance, problems:
  1) Changes of a superclass can unintentionally affect other subclasses
  2) It's hard to gain knowledge of behaviours
- Interfaces:
  1) fly() class method *to* Flyable interface with a fly() method
  2) problem is that in JAVA, interfaces don't have implementation code. No code reuse.
** 5 Singleton
- Violates the single responsability principle
- Has
  1) Static method .getInstance()
  2) class allocated variable (static) to hold the instance of the singleton
- Easy of accessing as a global variable, with the *lazy* instantiation of a singleton
- *static* all the things is possible, as long as it is self-contained and has simple initization
  can get messy
*** code: enum, thread safe
#+begin_src java
public enum Singleton {
  UNIQUE_INSTANCE; // more useful fields HERE
}
public class SingletonClient {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Singleton singleton = Singleton.UNIQUE_INSTANCE;
    // use singleton HERE
  }
}
#+end_src
*** code: lazy code, might bring problems on multi-thread execution
- *synchronized* to support multithreading, and not have 2 threads enter the method at the same time
  But it will add unnecesary overhead. After the first call.
   #+begin_src java
public class Singleton {
  private static Singleton uniqueInstance;
  private Singleton() {}
  public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
    if (uniqueInstance == null) {
      uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
    }
    return uniqueInstance;
  }
}
#+end_src
*** code: eager code
   #+begin_src java
public class Singleton {
  private static Singleton uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
  private Singleton() {}
  public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
    return uniqueInstance;
  }
}
#+end_src
*** code: "double-checked locking" volatile, synchronized block
- volatile, ensures that multple threads handle the variable correctly
#+begin_src java
public class Singleton {
  private volatile static Singleton uniqueInstance;
  private Singleton() {}
  public static Singleton getInstance() {
    if (uniqueInstance == null) { // 1st
      synchronized (Singleton.class) {
        if (uniqueInstance == null) { // 2nd
          uniqueInstance = new Singleton();
        }
      }
    }
    return uniqueInstance;
  }
}
#+end_src
* Book: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code - Martin Fowler
** 1 Refactoring: A first Example
49:00
- "Brevity is the soul of wit, but clarity is the soul of evolvable software."
- compile-test-commit
- It's much easier to improve the ~performance~ of a well-factored code base.
- Refactoring Types:
 | Extract Function                      | for example, from a case/switch to a function                                                  |
 | Replace Temp (variable) with Query    | reduces *mutable* parts                                                                        |
 | Change Function Declaration           | fn name change, or removing a parameter in favor of calling a function. Makes easier to 1). |
 | Inline Variable                       | same as 2) ?                                                                                   |
 | Split Loop                            | isolate the accumulation                                                                       |
 | Slide Statements                      | move declarations of the variable next the loop for easy 1)                                    |
 | Split Phase                           | divide logic                                                                                   |
 | Move Function                         |                                                                                                |
 | Replace Loop with Pipeline            | loop to .map() and friends                                                                     |
 | Replace Conditional with Polymorphism |                                                                                                |
- Javascript
  - Perform a shallow copy, to not modify aPerformance
    const result = Object.assign({}, aPerformance)
- Code Style
  1) Use *result* as the variable name to return from a function
  2) On dynamically typed languages, keep track of the type of a var by his name

* TODO Video: destroyallsoftware - 2 How and Why to avoid NIL
- Is a problem when it percolates faaar beyond one expect it to happen.
  - The introduction of the nil is not local to the use of it.
  - We might lose the line of the error
