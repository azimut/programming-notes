** Is Haskell a Procedural Language
   - Anecdote of working on a system that didn't implement function programming.
     And was growing "too large".
     Most of the code was IO.
   - They weren't doing:
     1) high order abstractions
     2) Data abstractions, operating on that data
     3) Representing things as a pure domain model
   - They needed to abstract and work with that pure representation and then do a min of IO stuff.
   - FP is a mindset, distinguishing between
     - actions (side effects)
     - calculations
     - data
