  - ShadowCLJS, ignores hand-written externs by default. Because they
    are supposed to be “automatically deduced”. And it works. Until it
    doesn’t.
  - upgrading your ClojureScript version ... it updates
    Google Closure, too, and the extern-deducing algorithm might
    change unpredictably between versions.
  - After 10 years, I’d say that ClojureScript is best suited for
    web apps, not pages. The minimal bundle size, the
    performance—you won’t really put stuff like that on your landing
    page.
