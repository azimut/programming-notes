- syntax:
  - use of ".." over "+"  for string concatenation
  - use of "--" over "//" for comments
  - use of "~=" over "!=" for inequality
- habits:
  - arrays that start at 1, are not going to help future programmers
- missing features
  - no unicode support
  - no var++
  - no var += 1
  - no continute
