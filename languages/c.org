* Book: Effective C
** 1 Getting Started with C
- C defines 2 possible execution environments:
  - Freestanding: no OS, embedded programming
  - Hosted
- A ~return~ from the initial call to the ~main~ function
  is equivalent to calling ~exit~
- Passing user supplied data to ~printf~ first argument, can result in a secvul (seacord 2013)

  https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim/
- Compilers: gcc, clang, visual studio
- Kinds of Portability issues:
  . Implementation-defined behavior: not on the C standard, but on a particular impl
  . Unspecified behavior: on the standard, but with >1 behavior defined
  . Undefined behavior: not on the C standard, explicit or implicit
  . Locale-specific behavior
  . Common Extensions
- -pedantic, notify portability issues
** 2 Objects, Functions, and Types
- "Every type in C is either an ~object~ type or a ~function~ type."
- IEEE 754-2008: the Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.
- The ~referenced type~ T derives a ~pointer to~ T
- A code block {} is know as a ~compound statement~
- C is ~call-by-value~ (aka ~pass-by-value~) language
*** Scopes:
  - file: declared outside a block or param list
  - block: declared inside a block or param list
  - prototype: on function prototype params
  - function: on function definition, between {}, only labels(?)
*** Storage duration
  - automatic: block scope
  - static: file scope (the word *static* can make block vars into static scope)
            Must be initialized wth a constant value, not a variable
  - thread:
  - allocated: dynamic allocated
*** Alignment
    Number of bytes between suuccessive addresses of objs.
  - CPU's might behave differently with aligned or unaligned data
    - They access data by word, and might be able to access multiwords with a perf cost
    - Depending of the CPU's word (16,32,64 bits)
  - malloc() is sufficiently aligned for all standard types
  - _Alignas(struct S) can be used on C11 to align by the type provided
    In the example for a buffer which is then casted to a struct
  - Can be weaker or stronger (aka stricter). Stronger have larger alignment values.
*** Object Types
- Boolean Types:
  _Bool introduced on C99, can store 0 or 1
  can be spelled just ~bool~
  defined in <stdbool.h>
- Character Types
  - char, signed char, unsigned char
  - All have the same alignment, size range, representation, and behavior
  - satisfies a minimum et of characters aka ~basic execution character set~
  - wchar_t is a chart type that takes more space (16 32 bits) to represent more chars
- Numerical Types
  - signed char, short int, int, long int, long long int
  - int word can be ommited on declaration
* Book: Modern C
- C is an imperative programming language.
