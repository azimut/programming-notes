- *Patterns* can be
  1) regular expressions
  2) boolean expressions
  3) special patterns
- No PCRE on awk, but yes on gawk
- Cannot capture specific regex groups to be used on action
- "==" will do a "fuzzy" matching
  eg: "23" == 23 is true
- use ~ and !~ to match a string or variable with a regex
  string ~ /regex/
- *variables* are all global,
  whathever you declare on a block, will be visible to the other blocks, for each line
