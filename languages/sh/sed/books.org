*** 4 Writing /sed/ scripts

- is NOT that /sed/ applies individual editing commands to ALL lines.
  But, /sed/ applies the ENTIRE editing script to one line at the time.

- compares two files, silenty byte by byte
  $ cmp --silent file1 fil2

- Types of sed scripts
  1) Multiple edits to the same file (multiple operations)
  2) Making changes across a set of files (multiple input files)
  3) Extracting contents of a file (address range)
  4) Edits to go (as part of a pipe)

- The order of commands is important,
  eg: non printed substituion should happen before, something that prints

- Examples on this chapter deal with a lot of TROFF file format
  an his utils (tbl,nroff,col,pic,eql)

- # aka "octothorp", for comments
  - on systemV version it is only allowed on the first line of the script
  - #n to not produce output (aka -n)
