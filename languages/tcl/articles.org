- Most programming languages blend syntax and semantics.
  Each language construct has individual rules for how it is written (syntax) and how it operates (semantics).
  The language definition as a whole includes all of these.
- In contrast TCL
  - only syntactic rule are those which define how to invoke a generic command and pass data to/from it
  - Core has no syntax for arithmetic expressions, this is delegated to *expr*
