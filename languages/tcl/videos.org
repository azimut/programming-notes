- A coroutine is a "possible callstack"
- It gives you a possible callstack that can pause in the middle a while/for loop
  This is all cooperative.
  There is NO way to preemptively tell a coroutine context to stop.
- Example: you can then call c1 and c2
  #+begin_src tcl
    proc counter {} {
        while 1 {
            yield [incr 1]
        }
    }
    coroutine c1 counter
    coroutine c2 counter
  #+end_src
- Example: with "lambda", which in TCL is just an *apply*
  #+begin_src tcl
    coroutine c1 apply [list {} {
        while 1 {
            yield [incr i]
        }
    }[namespace current]]
  #+end_src

- 1988 Released
- Homoiconic (Code is Data)
  - Everything is representable by a "string"
  - Commands emit strings, and strings are the things that you run
- Doesn't have keywords (?
  - Ships commands, but you don't need to use them
