** 15 Handling Events
 - Pooling: periodically checking a queue for new events
 - Handlers: actively notify us when a event happens
 - a node can only have 1 onclick= attribute, but many with
   - .addEventListener("click", fn)
   - .removeEventListener("click", fn)
 - the an "event" object is passed to fn
   | event.type               | mousedown,mouseup ?   |
   | event.button             | 1,2,3 for mouse click |
   | event.target             | originated node       |
   | event.target.nodeName    | BUTTON                |
   | event.target.textContent |                       |
 - events are *propagated outward*, a parent handler gets notified of events of their children
   - event.stopPropagation()
 - Default Actions
   - User agent comes with their own defined event Handlers.
     Example: clicking a link, pressing down arrow, etc.
