- Node is a set of libraries on top of V8
- *Focus is to do networking correctly*
- Tries to use the same terminology than browser JS (eg: setTimeout)
- You cannot "sleep" in node, no mutex, no halting
  - *you can idle*, which leaves the process ready for other requests
- HTTP/1.1
  - you can reuse the TCP connection to perform multiple requests
  - Transfer-encoding: chunks
    - A "framing" protocol
- Non-blocking style of writing code
- We can run concurrent things at the same time
  - without changing them to add another.
  - without the thread cost
  - aka mashing things together
- Problem with even loops:
  - You are always killing your stack
  - Unlike in function calls
