  - Emacs zoom window:
    Problem: with a poor window managing experience having the multiple windows provided by DAP-UI
    becomes annoying and impossible to use by defaul (unless you have BIG screen).
    And wanting to have always a debugger open is what I would like in emacs.
    Like carmak said, and how I live in common lisp.
    Possible solutions
    1) Zoom into one pane https://github.com/emacsorphanage/zoom-window
    2) ?? https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el

** Interview questions
   https://github.com/shomali11/go-interview
   https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo
   https://github.com/goquiz/goquiz.github.io
* TODO Tutorial: Learn go with tests
  https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests
** Hello world
- Rules for "testing" package
  - files should be {file}_test.go
  - functions should be prefix TestSOMETHING()
  - functions only argument should be (t *testing.T)
- t.Errorf - formated output and fail test
  t.Run - Subtests
  t.Helper() - used by helper functions inside TestSOMETHING() to clean stacktrace
- Named return values are a thing, they create the var
- functions naming:
  - public functions start with CAPITAL letter
  - private functions start with a lowercase letter
   * TODO Tutorial: Effective Go
  https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
- "go fmt" uses tabs
- Unlike C, is OK return the address of a local variable (!
** Control structures
- if and switch accept an optional initialization statement like that of for
- break and continue statements take an optional label to identify what to break or continue
- for
  - Go's for has no comma operator
  - ++ and -- are statements not expressions.
  - for pos, char := range "ANUTF8STRING"
    works and steps over each unicode code points
- switch
  - do not need to be constants
  - if no expression, it switches true, so if-else-if-else chain is possible ina switch
  - cases can be comma separated
  - case or default
** Functions
- named result parameters: get zeroed and if return has not args they are returned
- defer: runs just before function returns, arguments are evaluated when defer executes not when call executes (immediatly)
** Data
*** New(T) allocates a zeroed pointer of type *T, often ready to use.
    but different than a mere var
  #+begin_src
  p := new(SyncedBuffer)  // type *SyncedBuffer
  var v SyncedBuffer      // type  SyncedBuffer
  #+end_src
*** when just New() isn't enough a constructor is provided, which calls New()
    and initiializes the struct with some values.
*** Composite Literal
  - Can be used for arrays, slices and maps.
    [4]string
    []string
    map[int]string
  #+begin_src go
  a := [...]string    {Enone: "no error", Eio: "Eio", Einval: "invalid argument"}
  s := []string       {Enone: "no error", Eio: "Eio", Einval: "invalid argument"}
  m := map[int]string {Enone: "no error", Eio: "Eio", Einval: "invalid argument"}
  #+end_src
  - On a map, for a constructor
  #+begin_src go
    f := new(File)
    f.fd = fd
    f.name = name
    f.dirinfo = nil
    f.nepipe = 0
    return f

    File{fd, name, nil, 0}
    return &F

    return &File{fd, name, nil, 0}

    return &File{fd: fd, name: name}

    new(File) .. is the same as .. &File{} .. which is a .. *File
  #+end_src
*** make(T,...)
  - for slices, maps and channels
  - returns a not zeroed value of type T (not *T)
*** arrays (building blocks for slices)
  - arrays are values, you assign the whole thing
    - or pass to a function a copy the whole thing not a reference
  - [10]int and [20]int are different datatypes
*** slices
  - cap() returns the max length or capacity it might have
  - Slices hold references to an underlying array,
      and if you assign one slice to another, both refer to the same array.
  - If a function takes a slice argument,
      changes it makes to the elements of the slice will be visible to the caller.
  - However, the metadata (structure holding the pointer, length and capacity) is passed
      by value. So we need to return the slice again.
*** 2d slices...
*** Maps
  - Like slices, maps hold references to an underlying data structure.
     If you pass a map to a function that changes the contents of the map,
     the changes will be visible in the caller.
  - An attempt to fetch a map value with a key that is not present in the map
     will return the zero value for the type of the entries in the map.
  - Indexing also returns a second boolean value if is or isn't on the map.
  - delete(Map, Key)
*** Printing
  - fmt.Print() fmt.Println() accept multiple args and print default format
  - fmt.Print(), adds space between each
  - fmt.Println(), adds space between each IF an arg is not a string, and adds newlin
  - fmt.FPrint.. functions prints to a buffer (an object that implements the io.Writer interface)
  - Format
    -  %d format prints based on the type (uint/int)
    -  %v prints the default...what fmt.Print() will show
    - %+v prints with struct field names
    - %#v prints in full Go syntax
    -  %q quotes string or []byte
          creates a rune from integer or rune
    - %#q backquotes
    -  %x hexa
    -  %x spaced hexa
    -  %T type
  - to change the default printing define, *T is more effective to use than T for structs
      func (t *T) String() string
  - We write ...v after v in the nested call to Sprintln to tell the compiler
      to treat v as a list of arguments; otherwise it would just pass v
      as a single slice argument.
  - There is also ...T for a variadic number of arguments of type T
*** Append
  - You can't actually write a function in Go where the type T is determined by the caller.
** Initialization
- Constants
  - Defined at compile time.
  - Either: numbers, charachters, strings or booleans.
- init() function on each file, to verify or repair correctness of the program state.
    packages initialization >
** Interfaces and other types
- Interfaces
  - if something can do this, then it can be used here.
  - Interfaces with only one or two methods are common in Go code
  - A type can implement multiple interfaces.
  - For instance, a collection can be sorted by the routines in package sort if it implements
    - sort.Interface
      - Len()
      - Less(i, j int) bool
      - Swap(i, j int)
- Convertions
  - It's an idiom in Go programs to convert the type of an expression to access a different set of methods. 
** DONE Blank _ Identifier
#+begin_src go
_, err := os.Stat(path) // 1. on multiple assignment
var _ = fmt.Println // 2. To silence, unused imports
_ = fd              // 2. To silence, unsused variables
import _ "net/http/pprof" // 3. To import for his side-effects
// 4. to check at compile time that a type satisfies an interface
//    Only when there are no static conversion already present in the code (rare).
//    Global declaration.
var _ json.Marshaler = (*RawMessage)(nil)
#+end_src

** Preface: Why Write Clean Code?
> "We don't read code, we decode it -- Peter Siebel"
- ...homogenous code id more important than having complete expressive *freedom*
** Introduction to Clean Code
- TDD: short dev cycles, invites to question *functionality* and *purpose*
  1. Write (or execute) a test
  2. If the test fails, make it pass
  3. Refactor your code accordingly
  4. Repeat
*** Naming conventions
  - Comments:
    - goftm, all public variables and functions should be annotated
    - "tutorial comments" are useless in production code
    - "Document ~why~, not how -- Venkat Subramaniam (Agile advocate)"
  - Functions:
    - "The more specific the function, the more general its name"
      Start with a very broad and short function name. Run() Parse()
    - IMO, Part of the OO that is loss, (sometimes) is translated into names (less than in C tho)
  - Variables:
    - Opposite to functions: should be named from more to less specific, the deeper we go into nested scopes.
    - Do NOT name your variables the same as the type
      "You shouldn't name your variables after their types for the same reason you wouldn't name your pets 'dog' or 'cat' -- Dave Cheney"
    - Do NOT mix short and long variable names inconsistently
*** Cleaning Functions
- Function length
  "How small should a function be? Smaller than that! -- Robert C. Martin"
  - Code comprehension > Code deduplication
  - Avoid *Indentation hell*
  - TIP: if the *value, err :=* pattern id repeated more than once in a function
- Function Signatures
  - IT should contain one or two input parameters. Might be three.
  - Use and "Options" struct instead
*** Variable Scope
- Global variables are problematic and don't belong in clean code
- Non-Global variables with a large scope can cause problems (too).
  - Instead of expanding the mutable scope, we can just return a new value.
  - Variable shadowing can creep when doing ~:=~ inside a block, that (re)declares the variable
  - OK DUDE
    "Developers need to take responsibility for their own code rather than blaming these issues on the variable
     declaration syntax of a particular language like Go."
*** Variable Declaration
- Declare the variables as close to their usage as possible
  - Avoid C-style declaration first
- Make constructors for channels, that make() and start the consumption
  - Alternatively
    - wrap the channel in a struct, making the channel private
    - make a newNAME()
    - make a Send()
** Clean Go
*** Return Values
- Returning defined errors
  - Do NOT rely on the *magic string* provided on errors.New() to compare
    Make it global (4Head)
- Return default values.
  Like a global empty struct of the type needed.
- Returning Dynamic Errors
  - When there context details to be returned
  - Create a new interface:
    #+begin_src go
type ErrorDetails interface {
  Error() string
  Type()  string
}

type errDetails struct {
  errtype error
  details interface{}
}
func NewErrorDetails(err error, details ...interface{}) ErrorDetails {
  return &errDetails{
    errtype: er,
    details: details,
  }
}
func (err *errDetails) Error() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("%v: %v", err.errtype, err.details)
}
func (err *errDetails) Type() error {
  return err.errtype
}

NewErrorDetails(
  ErrItemNotFound,
  fmt.Sprintf("could not find item with id: %s", id))
.Error()
.Type()
    #+end_src
*** Nil Values
- Try to not return nil values
- Avoid access to potential unitialized values with getters
*** Pointers in Go
- Pointer mutability
- Scope/Mutability:
  - When passing pointers as an input parameter of a function,
     we are expanding the scope of the variable whose data is being pointed to.
  - Same with returning pointers, we leak scope.
  - Common Go constructores are still fine
    They keep the scope the same.
*** Closures Are Function Pointers
- We can use closure to partially overcome the lack of generics
  - Making it easier to add functionality without affecting other parts of the code.
  - Keeping the arguments of the closure small (1?) helps to decouple later
- Sometimes there is a choice between using a closure or an interface
*** Interfaces in Go
- Java or C#, intefaces are explicit
- In Go being implicit, it can be difficult to see which intefaces are implemented by a struct (aka ~contract fulfillment~)
  - Resulting in interfaces with few methods (to make it easy to identify satisfying types)
  - Or creating constructors that return an interface1, along with code to implement the interface1
  - Or we can check by asserting that the interface is fullfilled
    #+begin_src go
   var _ io.Writer = &NullWriter{}
    #+end_src
  - Or interface embedding in a struct field.
    "An interface method in Go is essentially a function pointer".
    Embedded interfaces:
    - are always public.
    - You can partially overwrite interface methods
    Some argue that interface embedding is good for mocking (implement just what you need for testing)
- Struct embedding, helps introduce new functionality quickly (clean code)
- You should be able to accept and *interface argument* but return a *specific type*
TODO: NewDocument() is missing a user argument for NewMetadata
*** The Empty interface{}
Type reflection or Type Casting
- An alternative developers use for the lack of *generics*
  - A way to accept all the types for argument
    - In print() family of functions
    - Or in .Decode() (in json package)
- In general avoid directly dealing with interface{},
  write wrappers (Get, Put) for the type you want (like when using tinyKV package)
