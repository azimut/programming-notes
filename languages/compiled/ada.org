- A subset of Ada, named SPARK, has been developed to eliminate all undefined behavior
  and to support formal verification of program correctness.
- Formal verification provides a mathematical analysis of source code to determine the
  correspondence with or correctness of the code implementation of the specified requirements.
- Rust has no safety critical coding standards, nor does it currently support formal program verification.
