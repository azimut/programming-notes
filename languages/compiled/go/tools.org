- For minimal size file:
  > go build -ldflags="-s -w"
  - -w turns off DWARF debugging information (no gdb/pprof)
  - -s turns off the generation of symbol table (no go tool nm)
  > strip -x

  - Emacs zoom window:
    Problem: with a poor window managing experience having the multiple windows provided by DAP-UI
    becomes annoying and impossible to use by defaul (unless you have BIG screen).
    And wanting to have always a debugger open is what I would like in emacs.
    Like carmak said, and how I live in common lisp.
    Possible solutions
    1) Zoom into one pane https://github.com/emacsorphanage/zoom-window
    2) ?? https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el
