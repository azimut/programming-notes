- Concatenative programming is so called because it uses function composition instead of function applicationâ€”a non-concatenative language is thus called applicative. [[http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-concatenative-programming-matters.html][1]]

  - term born with Joy (2001) and Manfred von Thun

  - in a world where
    1) every value is a function
    2) the only operation alloed is function composition
  - composition would be implicit "f g", first execute f, then execute g
  - to make incompatible function signatures work,
    functions have to thread the global state,
    passing it to teach other
