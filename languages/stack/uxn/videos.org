  #+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
  [[./uxn-architecture.jpg]]

- Number Types: always represented in hexadecimal
  - byte:    #1f
  - short: #0001

- words: can also be classified by what type of number they take from the stack
  1) bytes: ADD, INC, DEI
  2) shorts: ADD2, DEO2

- Example:
  - Show red to the screen
  - rgb color has 16 values for each component
  - Is setting #f to each of the 4 available colors (?
  - #08 is the device port for the red component
  #+begin_src
    |0100
      #ffff #08 DEO2
  #+end_src

- Example: alternative way to written it, using labels
  #+begin_src
   |00 @System [ &vector $2 &pad $6 &r $2 &g $2 &b &2 ]
   |0100
      #ffff .System/r DEO2
  #+end_src

- "Our philosophy is that to make fast software,
   you need slow computers."

- "Suddently that *skill* that you thought you had was
   actually entirely owned by someone.
   Even though you have been paying that software for years
   the moment you can't have access to authenticate yourself
   well, that *skill* is taken away. That scared us."

- ="Does it work offline?"=

- Xcode updates can be up to 11G, cannot be resumed.

- bbc domesday project: to keep knowledge for future generations
  - wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Domesday_Project
  - video ad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn0oFJU5pxM
  - based on a previous book of a "comprehensive store of national information"
  - used LaserDiscs
  - project failed in the preservation front
  - but worked as an Digital Encyclopedia at the time i guess

- Techniques for preservation
  - migration: periodically convert (cons: degradation)
  - emulation: mimicking hardware with software (cons: with time, chains of emulators will break down)
  - encapsulation: ?
  - universal virtual computer: paper copies of specs (cons: difficult translation into paper)

* DONE 23 | An approach to computing... | Devine Lu Linvega
...and sustainability inspired from permaculture

- 34:38 start general vm talk
  - assembly was "too vertical", wanted something like a =Forth=
  - has 32 op codes
  - inpired by =Joy= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)
  - not necesarilly recommends stack-machines
  - mentions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Abstract_Machine

- 41:00 start of uxn code
  - wrote "type" checker in assembly, to ensure no side-effects
  - mentions another stack based language https://kittenlang.org/
  - in forth you end up using registers or variables to do complex
    stack operations and that is a kind of global variable

    $ etags $(find src/ -type f)
  - %macros are a single word that gets replaced by a sequence of tokens
  - there is no difference between "#00" and "00" (except that # adds LIT?)
