    - mitigations
      - no PIE

** 13 The Great 202 Jailbreak
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVxeuwlvf8w
  - 1979
  - reversing of a phototypesetter Mergenthaler Linotron 202
  - unix v7 manual had typesetter
  - that is before laser printers
  - 6 weeks of reverse engineering
  - finally they created a chess font for a book
  - paper describing the reversing https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/202/summer.scanned.pdf
** 13 EXTRA BITS - Printing and Typesetting History
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdModNEK_1U
  - monotype, linotype, phototype
  - ~eqn~ wrote by Brian Kernighan & Lorinda Cherry, a troff typesetter for mathematics
  - 3rd generation of typesetters used minicomputers, and used *fonts* as data
    - Linotron 202, used a small high definition CRT to expose a bromide paper in it
** 14 Typesetters in the '80s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvwNKpDUkiE
  - 1982
  - description of the event http://web.archive.org/web/20140124044202/http://www.eprg.org:80/computerphile/newprotext.pdf
  - pre-postscript era
  - company that build the 202, also had one of the first laser printers (Omnitech)
    - 700dpi
    - but it broken too often, and was slow
    - Intel 8080, z80 (firsts 8bit cpus, not fast enough)
** 14 The Dawn of Desktop Publishing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rCNnMZrFUQ
  - 1985
  - Apple Laser Writer (printer)
    - CPU: motorola 68000
    - [[https://youtu.be/1rCNnMZrFUQ?t=453][logic board description]]
    - problem with old printers is the power supply
    - they can't give 7Amps needed for final laser heat
    - ~32 fonts, one font slot for different weight or oblique
  - PS
    - 2D graphics language
    - a page description language for printers
    - solves the problem of not needing a Mb sized .bmp in memory to print
    - pdfs are unrolled postscripts: longer, faster and predictable
** 15 Programming in PostScript
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_NXz7I5dQc
- eg: /n (i want to define a variable called n)
- eg: /n 6 def (binds 6 to variable n)
- eg: /OCRA 30 selectfont
  - /OCRA being a fontname
  - binds pointsize 30 to font OCRA
- eg: for loop
  #+begin_src ps
    1 1 n { % startvalue incrementvalue terminatingvalue
        100 mul 10 exch moveto
        (<C>omputerphile>) show
    } for
  #+end_src

** 16 Unrolling the Loops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXgBe2wvEA
- notes/scripts http://www.eprg.org/computerphile/PostScript/unrolling.html
- they needed to print something fast
- apple's first laser printer using postscript
- killer example was a income tax form
- eg: unrolled for loop
  #+begin_src ps
    %!
    % we start by redefining operators
    % making the file size smaller
    % bind forbids redefining
    /s  {show}       bind def
    /m  {moveto}     bind def
    /sf {selectfont} bind def
    /sp {showpage}   bind def
    /OCRA 30 sf
    10 100 m
    (<C>omputerphile>) s
    10 200 m
    (<C>omputerphile>) s
    10 300 m
    (<C>omputerphile>) s
    10 400 m
    (<C>omputerphile>) s
    10 500 m
    (<C>omputerphile>) s
    10 600 m
    (<C>omputerphile>) s
    sp
  #+end_src

** 16 PDF, What is it FOR?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48tFB_sjHgY
- postscript was a success from day 1
- pdf adoption wasn't
- took a time for the reason of the need to catch up
  - same document version for all
  - multi-os support
  - not being micro$oft
  - same preview as print
  - zoom/scalable
  - in needed a reader
    - and it needed to be free for it to be adopted
** 16 PDF Workflow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cFOsAzigyQ
- 330mb ppt > 210mb pdf > 10mb pdfwriter
- 1985 the apple printer demo
- 1993 the adobe pdf reader launch
- wait was due desktops weren't powerful enough
- ~distiller~ was the paid convert of ps -> pdf
- ~pdfwriter~ was the "driver" for programs to "print to pdf"
- still pending is the ability to *reflow* stuff (like in html)
- but unlike html it has *high quality* fonts (dpi measures)
** 21 Types of PDF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7oxZCgO1dY
- "All I asked was a PDF and all i got was a lousy BMP."
- Types
  - PDF(FTG) full text and graphics
  - PDF(I) Image only
  - PDF(I+HT) Image + Hidden Teext
    - OCR: non perfect, loussy
    - but searchable
