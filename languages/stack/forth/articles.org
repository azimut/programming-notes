* 23 | Forth: The programming language that writes itself

http://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html

- Programming languages often require us to explicitly name intermediate results
  so that we can refer to them.

- Working without names (aka as "implicit" or "tacit" or "point-free" programming)
  is sometimes a more natural and less irritating way to compute.

- Concatenative style has us =composing" functions (aka verbs) by siply putting them in sequence.
  Each function will be called in sequence.
  No names (unless explicit), just nouns and verbs.

- Joy, is kind of like starting with a Lisp
  - 2001-
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)
  - without variables
  - without traditional control structures
  - all functions are unary (arity 1)
    - take one stack, return one stack
    - implied
