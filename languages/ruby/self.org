  - Written in C
  - Author wanted an OO language.
    Didn't like Python, because it wasn't true OO.

* Language

- Typing: duck, dynamic, strong
- Everything is an object (including primitive data types)
- Optional () on function calls
- puts
  - short for "outPUT String"
  - available to all objects
  - often written without parentheses
- operators
  - + works for sum /numbers/ and concatenate /strings/
- indentation isn't significant
- most lines that look like *statements* in Ruby are actually *expression* that return a value

** Control Flow

- if/elsif/else/end
- while/end
- =statement modifiers=
  #+begin_src ruby
    return nil if user.nil? # guards clause, usually at the beginning of a method

    puts "Danger" if radiation > 3000

    square = 4
    square = square * square while square < 1000
  #+end_src


** Types

- nil
  - is an object, just like any other
  - represents the concept of nothing

- Array [] [0,2,nil][1]
  - Linear list, accessed by index
  - mixed type of objects

- Hash {} {"foo" => "bar"}["foo"] { foo: "bar"}[:foo]
  - key/value
  - An association by an arbitrary key type
  - Hash.new(0) # where 0 is the default value

- Variables
  - nouns of Ruby

- Strings
  - "",'' are string literals, from more to less work done
    - "" checks for escape sequences (\) and expression interpolation (#{})
  - Both single and double quotes are used to create strings

- Symbols :foo
  - like lightweight strings
  - immutable
  - used
    - as keys and identifiers
    - when you need a string but you won't be printing it
    - when you need to use the same string over and over

- Constants
  - capitalized
  - proper nouns of Ruby

- Methods (.)
  - the verbs of ruby
  - attached at the end of variables with by a dot
  - some methods (such as =print=) are kernel methods, won't use the dot

- Class Methods (::)
  - attached after variables and constants by a double colon
  - created with NAME.new
  - has/can have
    - each instance has an ~object_id~ /property/
    - instance variables
    - instance methods
      - called by RECEIVER.METHODNAME
      - a *message* is being send to the object,
        which contains the method name along with arguments
