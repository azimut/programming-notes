** 3 A Quick Ride Through Ruby

http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-3.html

- ="My conscience won't let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply that the language works primarily on the computer's terms."=

- Read the following aloud to yourself.
  - Punctuation silent.
  - "Punctuation adds meaning to words, helps give cues as to waht the author intended by a sentence."
  #+begin_src ruby
    5.times { print "0delay!" }
    exit unless "restaurant".include? "aura"
  #+end_src

- This one reads more like "shorter english"
  #+begin_src ruby
    ['toast', 'cheese', 'wine'].each { |food| print food.capitalize }
  #+end_src

- ="Ruby is built from sentences. They aren't exactly English sentences. They are short collections of words and punctuation which emcompass a single thought. These sentences can form books. They can form pages. They can form entire novels, when trung together. Novels that can be read by humans, but also by computers."=

- "Punctuation and capitalization will help your brain to see bits of code and feel intense recognition."

* Snippets

#+begin_src ruby
  width, height = `xrandr`.scan(/current (\d+) x (\d+)/)
                    .flatten
                    .map(&:to_i)
#+end_src
