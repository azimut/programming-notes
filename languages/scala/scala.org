* Language
** Standard Library
- https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/
** Binary Compatibility

#+begin_src
Scala doesn't have binary compatibility, you can't even use a library compiled for 2.12 on Scala 2.13. For that
reason library developers cross-compile to all versions they support.

This is fixed in Scala 3, but it's only valid for Scala 3 and higher, it doesn't help for Scala 2.
