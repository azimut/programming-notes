** 1
- is useful use a "match all" on a *receive*, because a process can receive messages we don't know
  and fill up the process mailbox.
- spawn(M,F,A)
- exit(PROCESS)
- erlang:processes()
** 2
- we can pass a function as a parameter
  message_router:start(fun chat_client:print_message/1).
- register/2
  erlang:register(atom_name, PID)
- dict:new/0
  dict:store/3
  dict:erase/2
- closures and anonymous functions still work on Erlang
- final program "registers" each nick on a dictionary along with the function that will print the message
  - there is still 1 process (the router)
** 3 Distributed Erlang Programming
- "pang" means boom/explode in sweden
  Is wthat net_adm:ping/1 returns when you ping a node that doesn't exists
- Example:
  - Multi-node
  - A single "message router"
  - Multiple "chat clients"
- Setup 2 nodes
  #+begin_src
  $ erl -sname foo -setcookie somecookie
  $ erl -sname bar -setcookie somecookie
  #+end_src
- Ping a remote node
  #+begin_src erlang
  bar> net_adm:ping(foo@localhost).
  #+end_src
- Execute a function on a remote node
  #+begin_src erlang
  foo> rpc:call(bar@localhost, erlang, date, [])
  #+end_src

- gen_fsm - using it for a very simple SIP state machine
- "I wish I'd known that when I started"
- from "M5 networks" company, VoIP company
- (Erlang is) Highly Concurrent
  - Tens of thousands of procesess ("threads") are no problem
  - each only costs you 1236 bytes of memory
  - primitives send/receive
    #+begin_src erlang
      NewPid = spawn(?MODULE, f, []),
      NewPid ! {message, Message},
      %% ...
      f() ->
          receive
              {message, M} -> io:fwrite("~p", [M])
          end.
    #+end_src
** Dialyzer should be mandatory
    - The compiler doesn't check types at compile time
    - Each module is compiler independenly
** The VM can crash
- Linked-in Drivers or NIFs
- Out-of-Memory
  - Non-tail recursive loops
    #+begin_src erlang
      %% Example
      %% non-tail recursive try/catch, before we had try-of/catch
      foo(X) ->
          try
             case f(X) of
                 continue -> foo(A);
                 done     -> ok
             end
          catch % try-catch must maintain the stack
              _ -> doom()
          end.

      %% Example
      %% tail-recursive using try-of/catch
      try f(X) of
          %% Exceptions throw here are not caught!
          A -> foo(A);
          _ -> ok
      catch
          _ -> doom()
      end.

  - Queue overflow
    #+begin_src erlang
      %% Example 1: with too many msgs the process won't be able to keep up
      %% called by a lot of threads...
      log_msg(Msg) ->
          logger ! {log, Msg}.

      logger() ->
          receive
              {log, Msg} -> format_and_write(Msg);
              _          -> ok
          end,
          logger().

      %% Example 2: "selective receive" mnesia:transaction/1
      %% Example 3: "selective receive"
      receiver() ->
          %% This is O(n):
          receive
              particular_message -> do_lots_of_work()
          end,
          %% This is O(1):
          receive
              OtherStuff -> do_other_work(OtherStuff)
          end,
          receiver().

      %% Solution?
      %% this is also a "selective receive", but only depending to the size of the queue after this point.
      %% this is due how queue works internally. It infers that you couldn't possible match older things.
      R = make_ref(),
      server ! {R, MyRequest},
      receive

** Integration as a UNIX-style service is lacking
- systemv/systemd integration
- erl -noshell -detached -boot myapp.boot
  - return exit code 0 always
  - -detach means no console output
- ~heart~ process manages processes restarts
- no way to do log rotation
  no way to catch SIGnals
- They created ~erld~
** Hot code loading is...interesting
- it's really hard
- it's hard to test
- there's no good tools to help
** System monitoring is vital
- number of processes

- queue length (esp for busy processes)

code https://github.com/jadeallenx/parque

- Modeling a game in the "actor model"
- Erlang has
  - Good at slicing and dicing network protocols (aka binary data)
  - "for free" SMP scaling
- "Spill Games" company uses erlang in their backend for ther games
  https://github.com/spilgames
- Erlang has a "gradually type system"
- Processes are the ~unit of computation~ of Erlang
  - Do not share memory
  - BUT if we have *binary data* (compile time dependent)
    erlang would pass around a reference.
  - https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/binary
    - "Binary sharing occurs whenever binaries are taken apart.
       This is the fundamental reason why binaries are fast,
       decomposition can always be done with O(1) complexity."
    - "Binary data is shared among processes. If another process
       still references the larger binary, copying the part this process
       only consumes more memory and does NOT free up the larger binary
       for GC."
** Example: Fizzbuzz
#+begin_src erlang
  -module(fizzbuzz).
  -export([t/0]).

  t() -> fizzbuzz(lists:seq(1, 100)).

  fizzbuzz([H|T]) ->
      case {H rem 3, H rem 5} of
          {0,0} -> io:format("fizzbuzz~n");
          {0,_} -> io:format("fizz~n");
          {_,0} -> io:format("buzz~n");
          {_,_} -> io:format("~p~n", [H])
      end,
      fizzbuzz(T).

** Example: Taipan
- parque_sup
  - parque_player_sup > player gen_server
  - parque_port_sup   > port   gen_server
- Game has 2 entities
  1) Ports
     - manages
       - a list of traders (arrive, depart)
       - dictionary of goods (buy, sell)
       - quantity and price of goods
  2) Players
     - manages
       - position/location
       - ammount of cash
       - inventory of goods
       - capacity
- Other player actions: buy/3, sell/3
- Port actions: buy/4, sell/4, get_price/3, list/1, state/1
- List products of each port: [ parque_port:list(X) || X <- Ports]
*** move/2

- CONCLUSION
  "How to we reduce the complexity of everything of we have been doing?"
  "Github is about cloning things. Is making things bigger and bigger."
  "We need mechanism to make things smaller."
- 1948, first computer program by Tom Kilburn
- 1985, start of Erlang
- Seven deadly sins
  1) code even you cannot undernstand a week after you wrote it, *no comments*
  2) code with *no specifications*
  3) code that is shipped as soon as it runs and before its beautiful
  4) code with added features
  5) code that is very very fast very *very obscure* and incorrect
  6) code that is *not beautiful*
  7) code that you wrote without understanding the problem
- aka shifting your mind between
  - the mode you are in when you write your code
  - to the mode you need to be when you explain when the code works
- RESUME: the "state" of a machine given by their memory/RAM
  is what ultimately determines a program's
  - reproducibility, the more it is, the easier is to "google" solutions to problems
  - predictability
  - failures
- RESUME: Adding a replica on a different machine, to handle failures, introduces new problems too.
  - distributing computing
  - parallel computing
  - concurrent programming

- "Software is a human thing, programming has nothing to do with computers"
  "We Write software for other people."
- "We are way past when we were worried about memory".
- You need to *spell out* your code to not be rude but chatty
  - "Functions are named *case* expressions."
  - It forces you spell out exactly what you are doing
  - Functions are good for naming decisions
  - keep working until is completing obvious
- Counter: you lose visibility on your flow control

* 15 | How to pick a Pool in Erlang without Drowning | Anthony Molinaro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO_97_6w5lU
- Why? For _shared access_ that every request might need access to.
  - Eg: configuration, cache, large datastructure, persistent connections
- Alternatives
  1) recreate from scratch
  2) ets/dts/mnesia
  3) external database
  4) in a process
- Problems with storing data in a *single process*
  1) Does not scale across cores
  2) Concurrency
     - Process mailbox (mostly) serializes requests
     - Theorically unlimited lenght
     - Only basic Erlang support for _back pressure_ through reduction counts (poorly documented)
- While in other programming languages you would use a _thread pool_ you use a _process pool_
- List of libraries, that work and are being updated

* 16 | Erlang and Deep Learning                      | Garrett Smith
- At the time of "alphago"
- reinforcemet learning: on it, we reward the computer for doing things we want
- based on ~perceptrons~
  - where we take multiple inputs
  - assign *weights* to them
  - *transform* them with mat multiplycation
  - output 1(one) value
- Example: a 3(three) layer neural network
  - 3 perceptrons at the input
  - 4 perceptrons at the middle
  - 1 perceptron at the output
- The ~deep~ part refer to the "hidden layers",
  the layers that are neither inputs or outputs.
- The evaluation of how close the output is to the desired one,
  from an initial set of weights. Is done by a
  ~Cost Loss~ function

    - Separate state, services, deployment
    - RabbitMQ
    - Riak for timeseries data
  * 3rd generation
    - redis to buffer nodejs work
  * 4th generation
    - Erlang
  * 5th Generation
    - Dalmatiner DB, to replace Riak https://gitlab.com/Project-FiFo/DalmatinerDB/dalmatinerdb
    - ZFS to take care of compression
* 18 | Scaling Erlang cluster to 10,000 nodes        | Maxim Fedorov
- about Erlang in WhatsApp
  - acquired by Facebook in 2014
- 2013 - 200 million users
  2018 - 1.5 billion users
- Speaker
  - joined in 2016
  - Network Engineer
- On the bought, they needed to migrate to smaller servers
  | From | Erlang R16, FreeBSD, IBM    |
  | To   | Erlang R21, Linux, Facebook |
  - "If you want to have a lot of network connections running
     Linux's epool() is not the best."
  - They move from 16 to 21,
    because the new version gives better performance without needing using BSDs.
- An erlang cluster is a mesh, each server connects to each other.
- "Every phone when it connects it spawns an erlang process."
- Distributed Process Registry solutions
  1) Coordinated:
     - global https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/global.html
       - based on a global lock
     - pg2 https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/global.html
     - gproc https://github.com/uwiger/gproc
     - s_groups? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWpsesw_UQU
  2) Eventual:
     - Riak PG
     - cpg
     - syn
     - swarm
     - lasp PG
- Process registry can be solved, by using 2 registries
  - a centralized one fast changing things
  - one distributed for rare changing thing
- Meta-clustering
  they avoided unnecesary connections between nodes with applications that will never talk to each other
- A single *pg2* cluster is capped to ~1K nodes
- ~wandist~ (internal project, extending erlang distribution)
  - for ssl support
  - SOCKS proxy support
  - delivery confirmation
  - standby connections
  - maintain non-transitive pg2 lists (!!)
  - compatibility (16<->21)
- Diagnostic Tools
  - built-in introspection:
    - process_info/2 https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang#process_info-2
    - statistics https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang#statistics_active_tasks_all
    - system_information https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/system_information.html
  - MSACC - microstate accounting (with extra acc on)
    https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/msacc
  - Lock-counting BEAM aka *lcnt* module
  - BPF/BCC
  - gdb (with etp-commands)
  - fprof, valgrind
