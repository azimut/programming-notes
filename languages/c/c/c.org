* Language
** Types
- struct intialization
  #+begin_src c
    typedef struct {
      unsigned char c1;
      unsigned char c2;
    } myStruct;

    myStruct _m1 = {0};
  #+end_src
- arrays initialization
  - globals and static are _automatically_ initialized to zero
  - arrays as local, either
    #+begin_src c
      int coll2[1024] = {0};
      memset(coll2, 0, 1024);
    #+end_src
  - arrays of structs
    #+begin_src c
      typedef struct {
        unsigned char a;
        unsigned char b;
        unsigned char c;
      } user_struct;
      user_struct arr[5] = {0};
    #+end_src
  - arrays in structs can be initialized
    #+begin_src c
      
    #+end_src

* 0x00sec - Remote Shells
**   I Use Cases
https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-shells-part-i/269/1

- in the cases when is not possible to even deploy a service like "ssh" or "telnet"
  you can easily write your own remote shell program

**  II Crypt your link
- https://0x00sec.org/t/remote-shells-part-ii-crypt-your-link/306
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling
- SocketPair
  - Used to transfer data
  - Are a pair of sockets that are immediatly connected
    Something like runing a client and a server in 1 call
  - Kind of like a bidirectional PIPE
  - Convenient IPC
- secure_shell()
  | Parent       | Child              |
  |--------------+--------------------|
  | socketpair() |                    |
  | fork()       | fork()             |
  | close(sp[0]) | close(sp[1])       |
  | async_read() | start_shell(sp[0]) |
- async_read()
  select()
  memset()
  read()
  memfrob()
- We use stdin socket as the input socket for async_read() on main()

** III Shell Access your Phone
- setsockopt() - SO_REUSEADDR

* 6.S081: Learning by doing
Catalog description: Design and implementation of operating systems,
and their use as a foundation for systems programming. Topics include
virtual memory; file systems; threads; context switches; kernels;
interrupts; system calls; interprocess communication; coordination,
and interaction between software and hardware. A multi-processor
operating system for RISC-V, xv6, is used to illustrate these
topics. Individual laboratory assignments involve extending the xv6
operating system, for example to support sophisticated virtual memory
features and networking.

You may wonder why we are studying xv6, an operating system that
resembles Unix v6, instead of the latest and greatest version of
Linux, Windows, or BSD Unix. xv6 is big enough to illustrate the basic
design and implementation ideas in operating systems. On the other
hand, xv6 is far smaller than any modern production O/S, and
correspondingly easier to understand. xv6 has a structure similar to
many modern operating systems; once you've explored xv6 you will find
that much is familiar inside kernels such as Linux.
