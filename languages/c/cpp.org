- how to herd developers?
- experiment using binary size as a metric to reduce complexity
  - on part of the VMWare codebase
  - they used multiple directories (me: maybe git subtree)
  - team looks for big wins or easy targets, unlike on a regular work
  - They had a goal of having a 40% of final file size
    once they reach it they are not enforcing it that much
- size https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/size.1.html
  - list section sizes and total size of binary files
- General things
  - simplifiy class structure
  - remove dead features
  - remove layers of indirection
  - remove un-used instrumentation
  - remove simulators and test code
  - rationalize logging
  - exception factories
- C++11
  - output paramters to return values
  - reference types (in heap) to value type
  - continuations from bind to lambda
  - range based for
  - final
- The rule is to measure
  The measure is not the rule
