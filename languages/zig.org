   Position:
     - Past: Erlang Developer
     - Present: Infrastructure
   Uber
     - Primarly Go (for infra) and Java (some rare C++)
     - Monorepo per language
     - Will use the Zig's C toolchain for crosscompilation
   Hermetic: when the tool to compile the program comes with the source.
     - Go is Hermetic (with bazel?), C++ is not.
