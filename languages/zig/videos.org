- almost the opposite design desition of *nim*
  - nim said no to interfaces
  - nim said yes to source code filters
  - nim imports are by default qualified (pull everything in) like in C
  - nim has exceptions
  - compiles to C, but not a single file

- *zig* says no to almost every feature
  - no function overloading
  - no operator overloading
  - you can stil put a function inside a struct
  - threats erros as values that you return
    - you cannot pass data with the error
  - nulls are *union* types "better than wrappig and unwrapping in the monadic style"
  - no package manager
  - drop-in c compiler

- comptime is good
  - 80% of the power of macros without the complexity
  - multi_array_list https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/multi_array_list.zig
    - takes a struct, and creates a struct of arrays
    - common in data oriented design to get better cache locallity

- Position:
    - Past: Erlang Developer
    - Present: Infra

- Uber
    - Primarly Go (for infra) and Java (some rare C++)
    - Monorepo per language
    - Will use the Zig's C toolchain for crosscompilation

- Hermetic: when the tool to compile the program comes with the source.
    - Go is Hermetic (with bazel?), C++ is not.
