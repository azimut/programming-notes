  - “if the only reason an engineer wants to work for you is because
    of your tech stack, that may be a warning sign. Culture Amp
    therefore avoids hiring engineers who are purely
    technology-focused. As a product company, we seek to hire people
    who are mostly excited about our product and its mission, and who
    are happy to learn new things when necessary to progress
    that. When someone tells us in an interview they’re excited about
    working here because they like functional programming (say), we
    count that as an indication they might not be a good fit.”
