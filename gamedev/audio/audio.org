- "Julian Peterson" about Borderlands game audio

 for the soundtrack I made linear presentations of the music.  In
 game, a lot of the material is broken apart into smaller segments
 that can be strung together, with those choices determined by game
 state.  In BL3 we track two primary parameters: threat, and interest.
 Threat is a distillation of 'how much combat' the player is engaged
 in (BL3 is a first person shooter), and interest is driven by
 numerous game events and determines how forward the music should be
 in the overall mix.  But of course, we also can respond to other
 changes in game state and events in the story.

  - Kinds:
   - Technical Sound Designer
   - Audio Engine Programmer
   - DSP programmer
  - Works involves working with middleware (wwise, fmod,...)
    Seems like working with openAL
  - Set3dListenerAndOrientation()
  - Heuristically-Grown Update Loops.
    Instead of adding feature after feature, use a state machine.
