- =Perlin Noise=:
  - can be described as slowly changing random noise.
  - There are version of perlin noise that take 2 values (2D) and others that take 1 value (1D).
  - Adding multiple *octaves* of noise. Of different amplitude/frequency.
    Causes the terrain from it appear more real.

- Noise Transformation: we take the oise and we do something to it
  #+begin_src
    var noiseValue = noise.sample2d(x, z);
    var surface = 100 + noiseValue * 20;
  #+end_src
- You can add a sort of mapping function from the noise value to actual height like:
  | noise | height |
  |-------+--------|
  |    -1 |     50 |
  |    .3 |    100 |
  |    .4 |    150 |
  |     1 |    150 |
- Minecraft, mixes 3 different noises
  - Continentalist, Erosion, Peaks/Valleys
  - They act different and represent differnet things in the world
  - They are mixed by 3 different mapping/spline pointos
    - Height/Continentalist
    - Height/Peak Valleys
    - Height/Erosion

- Details are controlled by *3D noise*
  - 3 inputs, coordinates of the world
  - 1 output, density
