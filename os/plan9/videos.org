  - the OS is designed as a loosely coupled services that can be hosted in different machines
  - while unix is "monolitic", has 1 namespace
  - plan9 has per process namespace, a namespace can have multiple processes
  - utf8 first implemented in plan9 (ME: rob pike created it afaik)
  - unix
    - wasn't designed for workstations
    - graphics/networking were "addons"
  - born from the desire to have centralized time-sharing
    on multiple cheaper computers (terminals)

  - ccc
  - made at Bell Labs
  - plan9 = unix + graphics + networks
  - mostly initially written by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson
  - 1980-
  - forks
    - 9front: main active fork
    - Plan 9: patches over the original
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)
  - ~40 syscalls
    - no ioctl
    - no sockets
    - no graphics
    - everything else is done through the filesystem
  - bind   copies something
    mount  adds something new to the namespace
    umount removes that
  - To get access to the other computer network.
    If you already have access to the filesystem of the other computer.
    Kind of a vpn.
    $ bind /n/dyaus/net /net
  - DEMO: 17:11
    $ mount /srv/rio.app.16734 /mnt/foo new # opens a new window
    $ cd /mnt/foo
    $ lc                                    # to list files associated with that window
    $ echo hello, vcfb >cons                # to print a message to the window
  - $ ns # is like a "ps"
