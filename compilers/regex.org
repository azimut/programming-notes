- *branches* are separated by |
- *branch* is made of *pieces*
- *piece* is an *atom* followed by * + ? or bound
- *atom* a literal or a zero-width positional pattern
- types
  - extended: egrep
  - basic: ed

- special purpose language used to recognize patterns within text
- called regular expressions, because they can recognize regular languages
  - (chomsky) hierachy of languages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy
    - from + restrictive to - restrictive
      - regular language (fsa)
      - recursive enumerable (recognized turing machines)

- finite automata, finite state machine (fsm)
  - "a kind of conceptual computer"
  - types:
    - DFA (deterministic)
      - each state can only go to another state given a particular input
    - NDFA/NFA (non-deterministic)
      - eg: (ha+)+h
  - parts
    - states (nodes)
    - transitions (vertex)

* language
** syntax

- quantifiers
  - greedy: matches as much as possible, as long as it finds the latter part of the pattern (eg: 'x.*y')
  - non-greedy: matches as little as possible to reach the next part of the pattern (eg: 'x.*y?')

** [bracket expansion]

- matches characters on the list
- ^ negates the match
- - ranges between chars
- [..] collating element

** [:character classes:]
