* 20 emacs: basics of regular expressions by Protesilaos Stavrou https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxYGHjKBMUg
  - C-h r i - opens official emacs doc keyword search
  - isearch - M-r to switch to regex search
  - phi-search - already uses regex match by default
  - flush-lines - removes matching regex lines
  - keep-lines
  - run elisp function with first match group
    - \,(upcase \1)
  - =multi-occur= package
  - =regexp-builder= built-in package
    - C-h m
  - =visual-regexp= package
    - good for regexp group replace

    - have their own regex card
    - have to provide words that match all the cards, without revealing them

  - regex to parse config file, with comment suppot (ME: kind of wonky)
  - regex to translate a path with many relative subpaths (trying to bypass a WAF) to it's realpath

* ⭐ 16 Catastrophic Backtracking ‒ When Regular Expressions Explode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP5xnHm45s4
- https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html
- the backtracking regex w/problems
  #+begin_src
   \n\nBIB: ([\w ]+?\d*(,\s|(?=\n\n)))+\n\n
  #+end_src
- Lesson:
  - use a non-backtracking regex engine
  - be careful when creating nested regex w/nester quantifiers (?+*)
  - ?> use *atomic grouping*
  - consider the failure cases
  - make sure there is only a way to do the matching
  #+begin_src
    (\w+?\d*,)*             <---- no
    ([^\W\d]+?\d*,)*        <---- yes
    (((?|\d)\w)+?\d*,)*     <---- yes
    (?>\w+?\d*,)
    (\w+,)*
  #+end_src

  - _"It's very easy in regex to get it to recognize what you want. But will it also reject what's bad?."_
  - the strange case of the empty alternative
  - aka when it's possible/valid to match NOTHING AT ALL
  - saying that at the end of the parsing you need to have something, IS NOT A CONTEXT FREE assertion
    - it's a context sensitive assertion
