- AWK
  - ME: In awk "pattern matching" is king.
        And strings and regular expressions are at the center of it all.
- "scrable score"
  - AWK's switch has support for regular expressions
- "grade school"
  - some community solutions didn't work for me as they won't sorting twice grade/name
  - it worked on their platform though
- "bob" - wacky regular expressions
  - [^a-z] matches a character that isn't a-z
  - [?] matches the "?" character
  - \s matches a space character
  - RS="^$", read the whole input as a single record
